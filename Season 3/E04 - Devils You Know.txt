Lori: I can’t tell. I can’t tell just by looking at it. Can you?
Shane: Nobody can. It’s chicken.
Lori: I think I’m gonna have to cut into it. There’s nothing worse than dry chicken.
Shane: Yep. I got you. Here.
Lori: Are you expecting someone?
Shane: No. No way. Alisha, what are you doing here? Hey.
Alisha: Sorry to drop by like this, but it’s important. The Terrigen got out.
Shane: When we saw Lincoln in the news and all that stuff about a government task force.
Lori: We knew it was bad. We just didn’t know how bad.
Alisha: The world sees us as a threat. We need to stick together, those of us who’ve been here since before the Outbreak.
Lori: Wait, are you the one who sent us that weird e-mail the other day?
Alisha: What e-mail?
Shane: The one about finding the rest of our people, bringing them back together.
Alisha: No. Can you show it to me?
Alisha: No!
Coulson: Alisha, talk to me. What’s happening?
Alisha: She’s dead. He killed her. It’s here.
Coulson: Daisy, Mack, move in now! Something’s attacking! Alisha’s down!
Daisy: No.
Mack: Sir, we’ve got three dead. We’re gonna need backup. Looks like the killer’s on the… Daisy, wait! Daisy! Damn it.
Coulson: Alisha! Alisha, can you hear me?!
Alisha: He’s here. He’s here to kill us. And you can’t stop him.
Morse: I assure you, we’re looking for the suspects right now. Please just go back into your apartments and lock your doors.
Coulson: Thank you for your cooperation. Detective.
Morse: Think they bought it? Don’t know.
Fitz: The old lady’s a trickster. Had her hand on one of those 911 Red-Alert necklaces.
Coulson: We don’t have much time before the official authorities get here. Gather whatever you can find before we lose the scene.
Morse: I thought this was just supposed to be a recruiting mission.
Coulson: It was. I don’t know where this attack came from.
Morse: Is Alisha gonna be okay?
Coulson: She felt it happen, went into shock. Med team’s evac-ing her to containment now. Before the attack, she said something about the couple getting an e-mail. Fitz?
Fitz: Laptop. On it.
Morse: What about Daisy and Mack? They could use backup out there.
Coulson: I know you really want to get back into action, Agent Morse, but the answer’s “no.” You’re still rehabbing. You haven’t passed the physical.
Morse: Understood, sir.
Coulson: Daisy, what’s your location? Daisy, do you copy?
Daisy: You’re cutting in and out, sir. We’ve trailed the killer to the industrial park a half a mile South of you. Backup would be nice.
Coulson: On its way. Hold tight.
Daisy: Copy that.
Mack: How did I let you talk me into this? I had a garage, workbench full of new tools, my own espresso machine.
Daisy: We got to figure out how this thing is finding Inhumans and why it’s killing them.
Mack: I know why.
Daisy: Yeah? Why?
Mack: Instinct. It’s like a great white shark, built to eat, sleep…
Daisy: And kill.
Mack: I was gonna say “make little baby sharks,” but then Jaws was probably 20 years before you were born, so…
Daisy: Do we have movement?
Mack: I don’t know. I can’t see a damn thing.
Daisy: Well, do you want me to take point?
Mack: I’m going. I’m going.
Morse: Hmm. Found something. Could be from our monster.
Fitz: Oh, blue. Not clear.
Morse: What?
Fitz: I said, “blue. Not clear.” How many times am I… Okay, look, Simmons and I have created a system. “B” is for “blue” is for “biological sample.”
Morse: Right, another system. How could I forget? Just saying… where I come from, blue is for recycle.
Fitz: Well, that is insane. “R” I could understand. “R” is for “red” is…
Morse: Regardless, we could use Simmons’ eyes on these samples. Think she’d be up for that?
Fitz: Uh, I don’t know.
Morse: Heard you guys had dinner.
Fitz: Mm-hmm.
Morse: She open up to you at all about what happened to her?
Fitz: Not really. Why? Did she say something to you?
Morse: No.
Fitz: Helicopters.
Morse: We need to move.
Mack: Oh, it’s got to be long gone. I mean, something that big can’t just slip away without… Damn it. I had to jinx it, didn’t I?
Daisy: Sounds like something’s trying to get out.
Mack: Or in. Come on.
Daisy: Three… two…
Man 1: Drop your weapons!
Man 2: Get down on the floor!
Daisy: Get down!
Mack: Get down! Put it down!
Daisy: Lower your weapons!
Price: Stand down! Everybody, stand down! S.H.I.E.L.D.’s not the enemy, and you definitely don’t want to piss off the young Agent Johnson here. We’ve got about 19 Agent Johnsons on our side, though none that can take down a building. Rosalind Price, by the way.
Daisy: Coulson?
Coulson: It’s okay. The ATCU is here to help.
Mack: Really? ‘Cause, the other day, they wanted Daisy’s head for their trophy case.
Coulson: Agent Mackenzie.
Price: Bit of an exaggeration. But that was then, and this is now. And right now, we’re here to contain a threat, same as you. Fan out!
Daisy: I get that you cut a deal with them, but for the record…
Coulson: It’s a means to an end.
Daisy: Ours or theirs?
Price: Bag everything, computers, clothes, phones, anything they’ve touched.
Coulson: Where are you taking the victims?
Price: That’s classified. Oh. It’s not fun when it’s you, right? Can’t believe I just said that to the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson: You know, I’m really not feeling the spirit of cooperation here.
Price: Yeah, we had an agreement. You were supposed to share intel.
Coulson: And I did, ‘cause, look, you’re here.
Price: How did you find them, Coulson? And why wasn’t I informed?
Coulson: You were informed as soon as we engaged the hostile.
Price: I’m talking about before you got here. This is the first time I’ve encountered a couple like this.
Coulson: How so?
Price: This wasn’t the usual response call to deal with somebody who just turned. Look around. No cocoons.
Coulson: Maybe it didn’t happen here.
Price: Shane and Lori Hanson. They lived here for the last 18 months, and yet never visited an emergency room, never missed time at work, didn’t socialize with co-workers, had zero presence online.
Coulson: So they were introverts.
Price: They were already enhanced before the outbreak. So I will ask you again, in the spirit of cooperation… how did you find them, Coulson?
Coulson: They were friends of a friend.
Price: You mean Daisy’s friends.
Coulson: Look, we can do this all day, but there’s an enhanced person out there killing people, and I’d really like to catch him. Are you gonna help or not?
Price: I like when you get all tough. All right, we’ll take it from here. I’ll call if I find anything.
Coulson: You’re welcome, by the way.
Price: Oh, don’t take it personally, Phil. I’m sure you have other evildoers out there to catch.
Ward: Nice haul. New recruit brought you these?
Kebo: Yeah. Same bloke who brought these took out spud last week. He’s a tough bastard.
Ward: I like that he didn’t come empty-handed.
Kebo: Might be helpful on the next job, whatever that is.
Ward: Sorry, Kebo. That’s level 7.
Kebo: Level 7? Right.
Ward: I’m messing with you. It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. thing. One of their ridiculous codes of bureaucracy, though I will say there are a few things that S.H.I.E.L.D. got right. Things they valued. And I don’t mean money or power or resources. Now, take this job, for instance. It’s all about accountability, patience, an attention to detail that requires a personal touch. Those kinds of things mattered at S.H.I.E.L.D. Almost a shame we’re gonna bring it all down.
May: So, what’s the job?
Hunter: Don’t know.
May: When’s it going down?
Hunter: Don’t know.
May: Any idea where?
Hunter: Not yet.
May: You do realize the point of intelligence gathering is to gather intelligence?
Hunter: The point is, I’m moving up the food chain. And that lunatic Kebo is finally bringing me in on a job.
May: Or luring you into a trap. We have to be smart about this.
Hunter: It’s not complicated, really. Just point, shoot, repeat as necessary.
May: You don’t have enough intel. It’s sloppy.
Hunter: If it’s a chance to find Ward, it’s worth it.
May: What happens if you walk into a roomful of Hydra enforcers with guns pointed at your head?
Hunter: That’s what you’re here for. To help. Try to keep up, love.
May: This isn’t funny, Hunter. What if there are innocent lives at risk?
Hunter: There’s always lives at risk! You were there, when Bobbi was bleeding out in my arms. Ward did that. If I have a shot at finding him, I’m taking it. I have to, before Bobbi gets back in the field.
May: Look, I want Ward as bad as you do. But I don’t think his life is worth yours or Bobbi’s.
Hunter: Well, on that, we can agree.
May: Once you get the time and place, call me.
Hunter: Yes, mum.
Morse: The DNA results came in. They confirm the killer is an Inhuman. He’s killing his own kind.
Daisy: I don’t get it. If he knows what it’s like, what we go through, I just… I refuse to believe Mack’s “great white shark” theory. He’s not some mindless wrecking machine.
Coulson: Agreed. The killer’s tracking its prey. The question is how.
Morse: Alisha knew these people. They were friends of hers before the outbreak. Maybe the killer was, too.
Daisy: It’s possible, but before Alisha was attacked, the couple mentioned that they got some weird e-mail, right? Well, that e-mail had a nasty virus attached to it. It chewed up the operating system like a blender. I was able to un-mangle it, and it looks like the virus was planted to track their location.
Coulson: Do we know of any other Inhumans who got this e-mail?
Daisy: Joey Gutierrez didn’t. I checked. But the others, I don’t know. It’s not like we have a ton of candidates to work with.
Coulson: Reach out to the ATCU. Let them know what you found.
Daisy: Taking this team spirit thing a little far, aren’t we?
Morse: Fitz and I grabbed that laptop before they got there. Why would we share this intel?
Coulson: We know the ATCU has found Inhumans in the past, confiscated all their belongings. Let’s see if they’ve come across this virus before.
Daisy: If we share with them, what do we get in return?
Coulson: What do you want?
Daisy: I don’t know. Let’s start with how many Inhumans they’ve come across, where they take them.
Morse: Daisy has a good point, sir. We don’t know nearly enough about them.
Coulson: I agree, but if you want answers, then you gotta play ball. Share the intel, trace the virus to its source.
Simmons: It was bitter, not sweet at all. I’d imagined the taste of a fresh strawberry for months, but like most things since being back, it just wasn’t what I’d remembered.
Andrew: Most things aren’t. Memories have a funny way of changing on you when you’re not looking. How about you? You feel any different since you’ve been back? Besides your taste buds, I mean. Any trouble sleeping or anxiety?
Simmons: No.
Andrew: Shock, rage, depression?
Simmons: I know you’re looking for signs of PTSD. But I assure you, I’m fine.
Andrew: You’ve been through something pretty extreme. There will be after-effects, and that’s okay. It’s okay to struggle, to feel uncomfortable in your own skin.
Simmons: I’m not one of your Inhuman patients, Dr. Garner.
Andrew: No. No, you’re not. But survivor stories have always fascinated me. How they got through it. The Chilean miners relied on routine, work, exercise, rest, gave each other jobs.
Simmons: They had each other.
Andrew: Well, not all of them. One hiker was stranded on mount hood for six nights in the snow. Said her faith saved her. That and the thought of all the loose ends she left behind, the people she cared about. She never gave up hope.
Simmons: I did.
Andrew: Do you remember a specific moment when that happened?
Simmons: Honestly, I’d rather look forward than back. I have a very interesting new project that I’m trying to focus on.
Andrew: Okay. You don’t have to talk about it. Just know you got a lot of friends here who care a lot about you. You’re safe now, Jemma. It’s over.
Simmons: You’re wrong.
Coulson: She puts up a good front, but I’m worried about her.
Andrew: You should be. The woman was stranded alone on a barren alien world for months. She’s dealing with a lot of emotions and won’t open up about any of them.
Coulson: I know you can’t discuss specifics, but is she making any progress?
Andrew: Nah. You can’t rush her. No field work. I mean it, Phil. And when I give you a recommendation, I want you to respect it this time.
Coulson: Hey, what are you talking about?
Andrew: I’m talking about the Inhuman you have in containment. You know, the one I never even met, let alone cleared for a mission?
Coulson: Alisha came to us. She was worried about her friends.
Andrew: And how many more like her are you hiding?
Coulson: That’s not what we’re doing.
Andrew: These people have problems! I’m not just gonna turn a blind eye and rubber-stamp them for your new team.
Coulson: And I’m not asking you to. This was a simple recruitment mission. Alisha wanted to go. Nobody saw that attack coming.
Andrew: You trying to justify that to me, or to yourself?
Coulson: May?
May: Coulson. Andrew. Am I interrupting something?
Coulson: I can’t believe Hunter reached out to you like that. I specifically told everyone to give you space while you were on leave.
May: Man’s on a mission. He’s desperate.
Coulson: How desperate? His latest bad idea, walking into a Hydra stronghold alone for a shot at finding Ward.
Coulson: I admire his courage. Sounds like suicide.
May: Ward knows Hunter’s face. If there’s a chance they run into each other on this job…
Coulson: Hunter needs backup.
May: More than I can provide.
Coulson: That’s saying a lot. Most of our resources are focused on focused on a manhunt right now, or a monster hunt. But if this leads to Ward, that would be huge. When is Hunter going in?
May: I’m waiting on specifics. But I know Hunter’s been operating primarily on the Eastern seaboard. He’s in too deep, Phil. It’s affected his judgment. What?
Coulson: It’s like you never left.
May: But I did.
Coulson: Look, I’m sorry Andrew’s here. I didn’t mean to make it more awkward.
May: It’s fine. We’re all professionals.
Coulson: Yeah, but we’re also friends. If the reason you haven’t come back is because we’re working with him…
May: It’s not.
Coulson: I told you, I can find someone else to consult.
May: Don’t. Andrew’s really good at what he does. You need him.
Coulson: Yeah. But I can replace him. You not so much. What happened with you two?
May: The reason Andrew left me had nothing to do with S.H.I.E.L.D. It’s… It’s about me. Always has been.
Coulson: You’re too hard on yourself. You know that?
May: Hey. No tie?
Coulson: Still practicing.
May: Look better without it.
Coulson: Thanks.
May: I’ll call you as soon as Hunter reaches out.
Morse: The hairs are deteriorating.
Fitz: That’s odd. Did you place it in the right receptacle?
Morse: And double-checked the seal.
Fitz: And the stain?
Morse: Fitz, we’re dealing with Inhuman DNA. Anything’s possible. I’ll check it again.
Fitz: What’s all this? Data on the Monolith? Schematics? There’s notes all over this in Simmons’ handwriting. Seismic mounts.
Simmons: What are you doing?!
Fitz: Cry… Jemma, I’m just trying to…
Simmons: No, don’t. Look, those are mine, and now they’re all out of order. And you what did you tell him?
Morse: Jemma, relax. We’re… We’re just analyzing the Inhuman’s DNA.
Fitz: All this data, what’s it for?
Simmons: Just stay away from my things.
Fitz: What just happened? Wha… Did she say something to you?
Morse: It should come from her.
May: Thought you left.
Andrew: I was waiting for you. Are… Are you back?
May: No.
Andrew: Melinda, can we talk?
May: That’s what we’re doing.
Andrew: Yeah. Not here. I mean… could you slow up for a second, please?
May: Honestly, Andrew, I don’t need to hear any more apologies. We went away to figure out who we’d be outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. You didn’t like what you saw. Let’s move on.
Andrew: That’s not true. I had a great time.
May: So did I, until you fell off the face of the Earth. No calls, no texts.
Andrew: That had nothing to do with you.
May: Please, don’t give me the “it’s not you, it’s me” speech. You can do better than that.
Andrew: You’re right. I… I can do better, and I want to. I’d just rather not do it here. Now, Maybe after my class tomorrow, you could come by.
May: I don’t think so.
Andrew: Damn it, Melinda, I-I know I’ve handled this all wrong. I shouldn’t have walked away like I did.
May: I did the same to you. Now we’re even.
Daisy: I reached out to the ATCU and talked to that guy Banks.
Coulson: What did he give you?
Daisy: Besides a case of the creeps, he said the virus I found was sent out to the other Inhumans they’ve come across. They just didn’t spot it.
Coulson: See? Cooperation pays off.
Daisy: It was hardly cooperation. Not only didn’t they find the virus, but they couldn’t trace it, either.
Coulson: I’m guessing you did.
Daisy: Meet Dwight Frye… former programmer, serial online gamer, and I.T. guy.
Coulson: The killer has an I.T. guy?
Daisy: What if he was one before he changed?
Coulson: Interesting theory. He works for the social security administration.
Daisy: Yeah, but he hasn’t been there in weeks.
Coulson: He’d have access to all kinds of records, be able to track people.
Daisy: Forget that. How did the ATCU not track him? He’s one of their own. He’s a government employee.
Coulson: You think the ATCU knew about him?
Daisy: Worse. What if they’re running him?
Coulson: I think the conspiracy nut in you had a few too many lattes this morning.
Daisy: I did have a latte. It was a double. But if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were defending the ATCU, or the dragon lady.
Coulson: I assume you mean Rosalind?
Daisy: There’s that first-name thing again, it’s a dead giveaway. I mean, don’t feel bad. She’s sharp, attractive, head of a big, shady organization.
Coulson: I don’t like where this is going.
Daisy: You think I do?
Coulson: Go grab Mack and a flight team. We’re gonna see what this Mr. Frye has to say for himself.
Daisy: Copy that.
Daisy: Look who’s here.
Banks: Her again?
Price: Remember, best behavior. Coulson.
Coulson: Ms. Price. See? Called you first this time.
Price: Very nice of you.
Coulson: Signs of life inside?
Banks: All quiet. Perimeter’s locked up.
Price: Once the threat’s contained, our holding facility is prepped to take him.
Daisy: I’d like to see that sometime, make sure you’re not going all Guantanamo.
Price: Oh, well, that can be arranged, as long as I can get something in return, like a visit to your secret base or maybe a ride on that fancy new plane?
Mack: You know that door won’t open itself, right?
Daisy: Hey. Hey. It’s okay. We’re not here to hurt you.
Frye: Please, get out, please…
Daisy: What? I… I can’t hear you. What did you say?
Frye: Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!! Get out!
Mack: Daisy, you all right?
Daisy: Yeah. But he’s not.
Mack: Mr. Frye, come out and say “hello.”
Coulson: How hard did you hit him?
Daisy: Not that hard.
Price: So what’s wrong with him?
Daisy: I don’t know, but I don’t think he’s our guy.
Frye: She’s killing me. Get her out of here.
Banks: He’s having some kind of reaction to our special friend here.
Mack: You think?
Price: If we want answers, might help if she’s not here. Just a thought.
Price: Wow, pretty strong meds you got here.
Frye: Ever since I turned, migraine hits me like a bus anytime I get close to one of… whatever we are. The rash is just a bonus.
Coulson: So you’re a divining rod for others like you.
Price: Is that how you find your victims?
Frye: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Coulson: We have all your computers. We know about the virus, how you sent it to all of them.
Price: You’re the brains of the operation, and your giant pit bull does all the killing for you. Is that it?
Coulson: Where you going, Mr. Frye?
Frye: What the…
Coulson: Be careful. It’s got a laser finger.
Price: Talk to us. How did you know who these victims were?
Frye: Lash gave me their names. All I did was track them down.
Coulson: Lash? Big guy, dreads, likes to leave holes in people? That sounds like our pit bull.
Price: Yeah, great. Looks like good old Dwight here will lead us right to him.
Frye: I don’t know where he is. I mean, he always comes to me.
Coulson: If all you did was track down the victims, how did he know their names?
Frye: Divine inspiration. You guys don’t get it. You should be helping him, not hunting him.
Coulson: Help him kill people… 'cause, sure, that makes sense.
Frye: Do you think he likes doing what he’s doing? He doesn’t. Ever since I turned, I feel like my skin is on fire and there’s a jackhammer in my head. I wake up thinking that the pain will go away, but it doesn’t. The only thing that helps is when Lash does his thing. Sends us freaks back to where we belong. I didn’t want this. And I know I’m not the only one.
Coulson: Mr. Frye, we can help you, but you have to trust me, this Lash is not some angel of mercy.
Frye: No, he’s no angel. He’s just a guy trying to do the right thing.
Daisy: Andrew could help him. There’s no way the ATCU has anyone on their staff with his experience.
Mack: And where are they taking him? Do we even know?
Daisy: We can’t just give them free rein like this. We can’t just look away.
Coulson: Mack, you accompany them. Check out the containment facility. Gather whatever intel you can. Report back to me.
Daisy: I should be on that truck, too, sir.
Coulson: We got a major HYDRA operation unfolding. I may need you.
Daisy: Not as much as Frye needs me.
Mack: Look, I don’t like it, D. You were in their cross hairs just the other day.
Daisy: Yeah, and look how that worked out.
Price: We’re ready to roll.
Coulson: Not quite yet. How heavily sedated is Frye?
Price: On a scale of 1 to 10, about a 6. No one likes a drooler. Why?
Coulson: I need you to squeeze two more onto that truck.
Price: That’s not what we agreed on.
Coulson: Sharing is a two-way street. We invited you to the party. Now we need to know what you’re doing with the guests. Come on, Rosalind. Fair is fair.
Price: Just give me a minute. All right. Hop on board. Do you really have a laser finger?
Coulson: Sorry. It’s classified.
Simmons: Looks like your rehab’s going well.
Morse: Can’t lie. Doesn’t feel like it.
Simmons: I understand. I read up on your surgeries, two on the knee, three on the lung.
Morse: What’s left of it. Don’t forget those fun-loving abscesses.
Simmons: Well, knowing you, I’m sure you’ll be 100% in no time. I’m sorry I snapped before.
Morse: No apology necessary.
Simmons: I thought you told Fitz what I told you, and I…
Morse: Jemma, seriously, stop. I mean, here I am, complaining to you, after what you’ve been through. Have you told anyone else that you want to go back? You might want to. There’s someone in particular who’s really worried about you.
Simmons: I wonder who that might be.
Morse: He’s driving me nuts, you know? The other day, he snapped at me just because I put a bio sample into a clear specimen bag.
Simmons: Clear? Well, “B” is for “blue” is for “biological.” And now I see how that would drive you out of the lab.
Morse: Actually, um… it’s not all Fitz’s fault. I just got this old, familiar feeling in my gut and had to run.
Simmons: What feeling is that?
Morse: Like Hunter’s in trouble.
Hunter: Clearly, punctuality ain’t one of HYDRA’s core values.
Kebo: Funny. Hands on the car.
Hunter: I thought we were past all that.
Kebo: Got to make sure you’re clean, director’s orders.
Hunter: Director?
Kebo: It’s a thing with the bos, some kind of S.H.I.E.L.D. nonsense. In you go, Richy.
Hunter: Oh, I ain’t getting in the bloody boot. It stinks of rotten bananas in there.
Kebo: It does, doesn’t it?
Hunter: Always in the bloody boot.
Kebo: Get comfy, now. It’s gonna be a long ride.
Hunter: Oh, when you say long, how …
Daisy: I feel like we’re driving in circles.
Mack: I bet we are. Probably buying time for Mr. Banks to clean up their facility. Didn’t you catch how fast he left the scene?
Daisy: Yeah, so he could get rid of anything “Roz” doesn’t want us to see.
Mack: Yeah, that, or he’s prepping a cell for you.
Daisy: It’s his funeral. I feel like his meds are wearing off.
Frye: I only told them the truth, that you’re being merciful.
Lash: I’m not merciful. I’m necessary.
Frye: No. No, no.
Mack: What the hell happened?
Daisy: The ATCU brought us all to a local E.R. to get checked out. You got a concussion, separated your shoulder.
Mack: Everyone else make it?
Daisy: Not Frye. Lash killed him.
Mack: Lucky he didn’t kill you, too.
Daisy: Yeah. Lucky.
Mack: What’s up, D? You holding something back?
Daisy: I… I saw something. And I’m not sure, but I don’t think Lash is just some great white shark. I think he can turn into a person.
Mack: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. You… You’re telling me that you saw him transform into a… a regular guy?
Daisy: It was all shadows, so I didn’t get a good look at him, but it would explain a lot. How he comes and goes, disappears when he needs to. I mean, think about it, Mack. He could be anybody.
Price: Oh, good. You’re awake. How you feeling?
Mack: Like a truck fell on me.
Price: Well, at least you lived to tell the tale.
Mack: Hmm.
Price: Where’s Coulson? I’ve been trying to reach him.
Daisy: He’s on a mission after a high-value target, a human one, so not your thing.
Fitz: Yeah, that space…
Coulson: About that… Okay?
Fitz: Yeah. Good luck.
Morse: Coulson’s leaving with a tac team?
Fitz: May and Hunter have a lead on Ward. Sounds like a dodgy situation… Wait. They didn’t tell you? I’m sorry. It’s tough when people keep things from you.
Kebo: Wakey-wakey.
Hunter: Where are we?
Kebo: Welcome to where all the fun begins. Director’s still mulling over a code name for the place… “Nemesis,” “Omega point.”
Hunter: Sounds a bit too S.H.I.E.L.D. for my liking.
Kebo: Rumor has it the director spent some time with them.
Hunter: You planning some sort of raid?
Kebo: Always planning something. You can ask the director yourself.
Ward: So, this the new guy?
Kebo: Yeah. Turn around, Richy.
Ward: Yeah, Richy. Why so shy?
Hunter: My name isn’t Richy, director.
Kebo: Get to cover!
Ward: Check the perimeter. Look for S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcements.
Kebo: I got nothing! Not a man, not a vehicle in sight!
Ward: Come on, Hunter. You weren’t actually dumb enough to come here all cowboy, were you?
Hunter: Sorry, this coming from the guy who shot his own girlfriend by mistake?
Ward: I was hoping you were dead and Bobbi was coming for me. At least that rematch would have been more even.
Hunter: Hardly. I heard it took two of you after hours of torture.
Ward: Yeah, lesson learned. Should have rigged the door with a grenade.
Hunter: Took your bloody time.
May: How many did you count?
Hunter: 11, including Ward.
May: I’ve taken out five.
Hunter: Slow day?
Ward: May, is that you? 'Cause that would be great. I mean, I was hoping to hold out for a little while longer.
May: Coulson, what’s your E.T.A.?
Coulson: We’re still 20 minutes out from your position. You need to get out of there, May, right now.
May: I’m not sure we can do that.
Hunter: I don’t care if a fleet of helicarriers flies in here. That son of a bitch is mine.
Ward: So glad you’re here, May. I was planning on heading out with a truck full of weapons that Hunter so kindly supplied. Looking to cause a little mayhem, draw S.H.I.E.L.D. out, when, instead, you came to me.
May: You’re trapped, Ward.
Ward: Hey. Don’t interrupt. Not before you see my surprise. That’s a live feed, in case you’re wondering. Dr. Garner’s on his way to teach a class right now, Psych 301, I believe. I’ve got my men on him right now.
Hunter: He’s bluffing.
Ward: Watching him die like this isn’t quite the same as, oh, let’s say, holding the woman you love in your arms while she breathes her last breath. But, hey… it’s the best I could do on such short notice.
Hunter: He’s trying to get in your head. The video is fake.
Andrew: Hey, what are you doing?
Strucker: Hey, professor. Where you been?
Ward: If I don’t call off my men in the next 30 seconds, Dr. Andrew Garner, the ex-Mr. May, is a dead man. All you have to do is put your weapons down, and I’ll let you go.
May: Son of a bitch. You’re lying!
Ward: I’m not. Give you my word, May.
Strucker: You know, you’re a tough guy to track down.
Andrew: What’s going on here, Alex?
Hunter: He has a warehouse full of guns here that I brought him. A lot of people will die, May. May!
May: It’s Andrew.
Hunter: I’m sorry.
May: No!
Coulson: May, what’s happening? Come in. May. 
May: It’s Andrew. Ward’s going to kill him. You have to get to him!
Kebo: Come on! Come on!
Simmons: Come in. Thank you, Fitz, but there’s no reason to dote over me. I’m fine.
Fitz: Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma? I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you’ve been doing, and… I just can’t understand it. After everything you’ve been through. Why would you…
Simmons: Because I have to get back there. And I need your help to do it. Something happened to me, Fitz, on the other side. It’s time I told you the truth, about everything.
