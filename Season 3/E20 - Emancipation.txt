Reporter: Still no word on the whereabouts of Steve Rogers after his public feud with Tony Stark and the Avengers over the controversial Sokovia Accords. Ratified by 117 countries, the Accords place the Avengers under U.N. authority and provide a framework for the registration and monitoring of all Enhanced Individuals.
May: We knew this was gonna happen sooner or later.
Coulson: Cap, Agent Carter, they were my heroes growing up. Both of them were there at the beginning of S.H.I.E.L.D. Now we may be there when it ends.
May: The last thing we need right now is the government hamstringing us with the Accords. We need to stop Hive by any means necessary.
Coulson: I’ll deal with the government. You do whatever it takes to end this.
May: All options on the table?
Coulson: Desperate times, desperate measures. You might want to go out the back. He’s coming in.
Coulson: General Talbot, right on time.
Talbot: What in the Knievel happened to you?
Coulson: Little fender bender. No big deal.
Talbot: You sure you should be in the driver’s seat? I thought we agreed on full disclosure.
Coulson: You want to see my X-rays? I’ll put them in a nice frame for you.
Talbot: I’m talking about this gin joint out in the middle of no man’s land. You promised me you’d show me the base without any three-hour fly-arounds this time.
Coulson: We need to talk first.
Talbot: I’ll talk. You listen. I’m here because the president sent me. The Sokovia Accords are law of the land now. He’s concerned you may have some undocumented Enhanced assets working for you.
Coulson: And why would they think that?
Talbot: ‘Cause he’s not a moron. Come on, Phil. It’s time for S.H.I.E.L.D. to come in from the cold, relegitimize.
Coulson: In exchange for revealing and registering any Inhumans we may have? Not gonna happen.
Talbot: Why are you so pigheaded? It’s good enough for the Avengers.
Coulson: Not all of them. And the Avengers operate in the spotlight. We work in the shadows.
Talbot: What’s going on in those shadows, Phil? That’s what I want to know. You better start opening some doors, or I promise ya, I’m gonna start kicking them down.
Coulson: All right. Let’s go for a ride.
Talbot: No blindfold?
Coulson: No blindfold, but you might want to buckle up.
Talbot: What?
Daisy: You’re getting better, Fitz, but I designed the anti-subversion code, so it’s only a matter of time until… I’m in. Huh. Interesting. They still have got you locked up. Was somebody being a bad boy?
Hive: You like the bad boys.
Daisy: We have a history. I thought we had a future once, but I gave him his chance and he refused, so now I just feel sorry for him. Ah, damn it, Fitz.
Hive: Your friends are very persistent. They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time. If it happens again, there’ll be no absolution.
Daisy: It won’t. Fitz is on the losing end of this. We’ll get back into the system, and we’ll know every move they make.
Radcliffe: How’s our patient?
Daisy: I’m fine except for the bright light shining in my eye.
Radcliffe: I think that’s enough for one day. Don’t want to kill the golden goose. Just take it easy. You just drink this and get some rest. No, that.
Daisy: I think you’re the one who needs rest.
Radcliffe: Well, we’ll rest when we’re dead. Not you. I-I didn’t mean… It’s just a phrase. No need for any deaths. We’re ready for the alpha test.
Hive: You were confident the last time.
Radcliffe: True. But this time, we have all the right ingredients. We just need to find some volunteers.
Hive: I’m recruiting some, special ones. A little gift for Daisy.
May: Time for your feeding.
Lincoln: Your sense of humor needs work. How much longer are you gonna keep me locked up in here? It’s been days.
May: As long as it takes. Your immune system is still compromised.
Lincoln: There’s nothing wrong with me.
May: And losing Daisy has made you irrational. Everything you’ve done to try to help her has made things worse.
Lincoln: Doesn’t give you the right to keep me locked up.
May: You want to leave? We can hand you over to General Talbot right now. He’s right upstairs.
Lincoln: He’s here? Why?
May: To take inventory. You really want to help Daisy, then you need to straighten up and fly right. And eat something.
Simmons: He’s lucky we’re feeding him at all.
Fitz: Doesn’t even need to be there. He’s fine now.
Simmons: Coulson wants him locked up. We destroyed all our work on the Hive cure, and now you have to spend all your time Daisy-proofing security.
Fitz: Yeah. Believe me, I know. It’s like Whac-a-Mole. Knock her out of one hole, she just pops back up into another. Could really use Mack’s help. How is he?
Simmons: Well, stress fractures are healing. Broken ribs and fingers still need time. It’s his broken spirit that worries me. He hasn’t been the same since Daisy…
Fitz: Feels like everything’s going to hell and all we’re doing is slowing down the descent. Okay. That should keep her out for an hour. Or a minute. Any plans?
May: I need you to forget about Daisy. She already knows everything about us, and she’s going to get in eventually. Time to stop playing defense and get back on offense. I need you to start thinking like Hive. Get inside his twisted brain. What drives him? What does he want?
Simmons: He’s a parasite. All he wants to do is consume.
May: But he also has humans in there somewhere, and you’ve spent significant time with two of them. We need to know his end game, and we need to know it yesterday.
Talbot: Son of a gun. Right under my nose this whole time, like a pack of sewer rats. I didn’t even know this SSR base existed.
Coulson: It was never on the books. I’d like to keep it that way. I’m trusting you with our biggest secret. Now I need you to trust me. Don’t report our Inhumans. Some battles need to be fought with secret warriors.
Talbot: How many you got? I know about Daisy and Electro-Boy. Who else?
Coulson: You’re about to meet one. Welcome back, Ms. Rodriguez.
Elena: Director Coulson.
Coulson: Mack couldn’t be here. He sends his regards. This is Brigadier General Talbot, acting head of the ATCU. Here’s here to…
Elena: I know why. I watch the news.
Coulson: We found Ms. Rodriguez in Colombia. She was being a real thorn in the side of the drug cartels, using her powers to clean up her neighborhood, to fight the good fight.
Elena: Put me on your list, there will be a price on my head.
Talbot: Nobody would ever find out about it.
Elena: (in Spanish) Naive.
Coulson: I think that means…
Talbot: I know what she’s saying. What are her powers?
Coulson: Elena, the general would like to see what you can do.
Talbot: Any time.
Coulson: Thank you. So, she’s really fast.
Talbot: Fast, yeah.
Coulson: And she can fend for herself. Not all Inhumans can. Most of them are regular people with lives and families who just want to be left alone. If you force them to register…
Talbot: It’s a protected list. It’s highly classified. You had an index…
Coulson: Which is why I know nothing good ever comes from putting people on lists. Eventually they get misused or fall into the wrong hands, and then innocent people suffer.
Jackson: It’s not a bad bunch, but we need more. Recruitment’s getting harder. People think the Sokovia Accords will solve everything.
Boggs: The Sokovia Accords are a joke. We don’t need registration. We need extermination.
Jackson: I have a new informant in the ATCU, gave me the name of someone on their list.
Boggs: We can make an example of this one. The world needs to know that Inhumans are a disease, and we’re the only cure.
Man: Fire!
Lincoln: Daisy, are you listening? I know if there’s a way to get in here, you’ll find it. So if you are listening, I need to talk to you. I want to see you.
Daisy: You can move now. I made a loop of you sleeping so if anyone checks the monitor, that’s all they’ll see. We can talk privately.
Lincoln: It’s good to see you. Are you okay?
Daisy: Fine. Just feeling a little drained. What about you? Why are you locked up?
Lincoln: Honestly, they don’t trust me. They think I’ve lost my mind over you.
Daisy: Well, is it true?
Lincoln: You know you’re the only reason I was ever here. And they know it. Now that you’re gone…
Daisy: I gave you a chance to come with me. We could be together right now, but you said no.
Lincoln: I said no to being brainwashed. I don’t want to be with you that way.
Daisy: Do I sound brainwashed to you?
Lincoln: I don’t know. I just… I just want to be with you. No Hive, no S.H.I.E.L.D., just… just the two of us alone and away from everything, just seeing the world. I-I don’t even know if that’s possible.
Daisy: Hold that thought. We’ll have to talk later. You’ve got company.
Lincoln: When can we talk again?
Daisy: I got to go. ast. I miss you. Get back in bed, and I’ll cut the feed in three, two, one.
Talbot: Well, well, well, if it isn’t the hothead that tried to kill my bodyguard.
Lincoln: What’s he doing in here? Thought this was a germ-free zone.
Coulson: I see you two remember each other.
Elena: You’re not happy to see me.
Mack: No, I’m not.
Elena: Why are you being like this? I came here to fight, to save Daisy.
Mack: Because it’s a fight we can’t win.
Elena: What happened to you?
Mack: Daisy. She lost her soul to that thing. I don’t want what happened to her to happen to someone else I care about. The sway, whatever he does to them, it’s… it’s not even the worst thing that’s gonna happen.
Elena: No?
Mack: No.
Elena: What is?
Mack: Armageddon. Whatever he’s doing is pure evil. I’m talking end-times Biblical evil, 2,000-years-of-darkness evil.
Elena: You need a beer. And some faith.
Mack: Hmm. You ever wonder if that’s the word we use to… to fool ourselves, give us false hope?
Elena: That’s how evil wins. When good people begin to, uh… doubt and run the other way instead of stand up and fight. Yu see it everywhere. In Colombia, we have a saying. El mal presa a los debiles porque teme a los fuertes.
Mack: Evil preys on the weak because it fears the strong.
Jackson: The guy in the black hoodie, that was him.
Boggs: We want him alive. Save all the fun till we’re back at the base.
Talbot: This is exactly why we need the Accords. It’s about protection.
Lincoln: Whose protection?
Talbot: Everyone’s. People need to be protected when one of you runs amok. Some of you need protection from yourselves. Is that why you have him caged up?
Coulson: He’s under medical observation, general.
Talbot: I’ve seen him in the field. He has control issues, lethal control issues.
Coulson: Issues that S.H.I.E.L.D.’s uniquely qualified to help him with.
Lincoln: How does this registration work? You put us on a list. Then what?
Talbot: Fingerprints. DNA samples. We run a power analysis to categorize your threat level. Also used to determine health risks.
Lincoln: Fine. I’ll register. Sign me up.
Coulson: I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Lincoln: I don’t think keeping me locked up is a good idea, either. Get me the hell out of here, and I’ll register and tell you anything you want to know.
Coulson: It’s in everyone’s best interest to keep him here right now.
Lincoln: Not mine.
Talbot: If you’re in here against your will, what’s keeping you from just zapping the two of us right now?
Lincoln: Absolutely nothing. I could fry that mustache right off your face. But that’s just not who I am. Besides, I’d never make it off the base, not without help.
Talbot: All right, Coulson. I’ve seen the good and the bad. Now show me the ugly.
Talbot: What the hell is that? You’re keeping monsters on your base now?
Coulson: Breathe, General. It was Dr. Garner before he changed permanently.
Talbot: Rasta-Hulk is your husband? I don’t care if that thing used to be Gandhi. Why on God’s crusty pie is it here? It needs to be frozen in a Gel-Matrix Cube.
Coulson: He may prove to be an asset.
Talbot: An asset? What you have is an out-of-control freak show down here, Coulson. What other surprises have you got for me?
Coulson: This is it. You wanted open doors. You got them.
Daisy: Lincoln. Do you really want to leave?
Lincoln: Only if I can see you.
Talbot: Where’s Daisy Johnson?
May: She’s on assignment.
Talbot: On assignment for who? I’ve got satellite imagery here of her and a dead man strolling down lover’s lane in a town where an unidentified object crashed the night before.
Coulson: If you knew this the whole time, why’d you wait until now to show me?
Talbot: Phil, I wanted to see if you’d lie to my face.
Coulson: I had no choice. The stakes were too high.
Talbot: What are you up against? What is at stake?
Coulson: The world as we know it.
Watchdog: End of the line, Inhuman. There’s nowhere left to run.
James: I suppose there’s always Hell. Well, look at that. A real hot dog. But seriously, who follows a stranger down a dark alley dressed as pups? I mean, on principle alone, I can’t let this end well for ya.
Hive: Leaving so soon?
Watchdog: Who are you?
Hive: I’m the one who invited you. As you can tell, I’m not with the ATCU.
Watchdog: What did you want from us?
Hive: I want you to become what you hate.
Talbot: The devil? You must be kidding me.
Fitz: Technically, it’s not the devil, but many of the myths about the devil are derived from Hive and the cults that worshipped him as HYDRA.
Talbot: You’re saying a demon possessed Grant Ward.
Coulson: It’s not “The Exorcist.” There’s nothing demonic about Hive. He’s an Inhuman.
Simmons: An Inhuman who’s made up of an indeterminable amount of Nano-Parasites. Those nano-parasites can consume human flesh upon contact, but when they make contact with Inhumans, they attack the pleasure centers of the brain, giving its victims a desire and willingness to connect with Hive and to serve him.
Talbot: So he’s controlling Daisy. Is that it?
Coulson: That’s it.
Talbot: This is exactly why the Sokovia Accords were created. This is a nightmare scenario. She’s a nuclear weapon in the wrong hands. How many of these Inhumans is he controlling?
Coulson: Not many. He tried to create his own, but we rained on that parade.
Simmons: We did. But, sir, he may actually have everything he needs now.
Coulson: All cards on the table, Dr. Simmons. I want General Talbot on the same page as the rest of us.
Fitz: All right, well, we’ve been trying to put the pieces together to determine possible end-game scenarios.
Simmons: We know he wanted Kree blood so he can duplicate the original Kree experiment.
Fitz: That’s turning a human into an Inhuman.
Coulson: The Kree were destroyed. May and Mack made sure of that. There’s no more Kree blood.
Simmons: Yes, there is. You have it, and so does Daisy. He can use her blood.
Talbot: So just take some of Daisy’s blood and make more of these. You know how crazy this sounds, right?
Coulson: But that would kill her. Do you really think he’d sacrifice her just to make a few more Inhumans? With her powers, her knowledge, she’s worth 100.
Fitz: What if he could make that many?
Simmons: With enough of Daisy’s blood, the Terrigen Crystals they have, Hive’s own particulate DNA, and a scientist who knows how to stir the cocktail…
Fitz: He could create an all-in-one virus that instantly transforms any humans into swayed Inhumans completely under his control.
James: Move along, little puppies.
Radcliffe: These are volunteers?
Hive: Sometimes they need a little extra motivation.
Boggs: Do whatever you want to us. It doesn’t change the fact that you’re all abominations!
James: Shut your blowhole, preacher. You’re about to join the evolution.
Hive: Their lives have been filled with such hatred. Now they’ll find peace with us.
Daisy: They don’t deserve it.
Hive: Every human deserves a chance to be freed from his prison. Their emancipation will be my gift to you. Are you still confident?
Radcliffe: 100% fairly certain. Now we wait.
Hive: Have you accessed S.H.I.E.L.D.’s security system?
Daisy: I’m in. I found their weak spot.
Hive: Good. Keep me updated. And please rest. We may need some more blood.
Daisy: It’s time. Are you ready?
Lincoln: Let’s do it.
Daisy: Okay. I’m limited in what I can do, so this is gonna be a team effort. First, we have to get you out of there, but Fitz closed the loopholes after I escaped, so I can’t open the door, but we can still MacGyver you out.
Lincoln: I can handle this.
Daisy: No, no, no, no. Stop. I said MacGyver, not “Firestarter.” Zapping it will trigger the alarms. We have to open it while tricking it into thinking it’s closed at the same time. Okay, let’s see what we have to work with. Okay, you’re gonna need, uh, that tape dispenser, a pencil, your food tray, and a piece of that mirror.
Talbot: Do you have any idea how to stop him? I mean, you make him sound invincible.
Coulson: Calm down, General. You’ll pull something.
Talbot: “Calm down?” This is an ?end-of-the-world type deal. Don’t you tell me to calm down. I’m the one that tells you to calm down. How are you so calm, anyway?
Coulson: I’m getting used to this sort of thing.
Daisy: Okay, here’s what you need to do. You see that laser circuit in the back? You need to interrupt it with the mirror. Don’t touch anything else. Okay, hold it there. Now plug in the spool from the tape dispenser. Perfect. Now remove the pencil and grab the food tray. I’ll be monitoring you through the surveillance camera. When the door opens, you’ll have three minutes to get to the exit point. Get ready.
Lincoln: What’s the tray for?
Daisy: Him. Now grab his comms.
Coulson: We’re exploring some options.
Talbot: Options? That’s what you’ve got? You told me this thing could take out an entire planet. I got an option for ya. A preemptive strike. This isn’t a job for S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a job for the United States military.
Coulson: You want to make that call? Go ahead. But you’ll probably lose them at “devil.”
Talbot: Do you think I’m an idiot? I wouldn’t tell them the truth.
Coulson: Even if they could be convinced, by the time we dealt with all their second-guessing and red tape, whatever Hive’s planning would already be done.
Lincoln: Am I clear?
Daisy: Lincoln, hold. May’s coming.
Lincoln: Where? I don’t see her.
Daisy: She’s approaching the intersection. Hang tight. I’ll distract her. Now, Lincoln. Go now. Okay, you’re in the clear. Proceed to the exit point.
Fitz: We shouldn’t act without knowing the last piece of the puzzle. Hive and his hole-in-the-wall gang recently stole something from an ATCU facility in Indiana. Till we find out what that is…
Simmons: Acting without all the information could make things worse. It could be what Hive wants. He was the only thing to survive on that planet, and he survived for a reason.
Talbot: So what do you want me to do?
Coulson: Trust us.
Fitz: Oh, Daisy’s back in the system. She circumnavigated the anti-subversion code and gained access to Lincoln.
Talbot: That boy sure sleeps a lot.
Fitz: Unless…
Simmons: It’s a pre-recorded loop.
Fitz: Hey. You’re all right. You’re all right. Help is on its way.
Talbot: Trust you?
Radcliffe: Oh, my God. What have I done?
James: I think you overcooked them, doc.
Talbot: How can I trust you when you can’t even keep track of your own Inhumans? That’s two of them you’ve lost.
Coulson: I should’ve left you in the bar.
May: What’s happening?
Talbot: Hothead is loose, and he’s getting help from Swazy Daisy.
Coulson: He’s not going anywhere. The base is sealed, and Fitz is freezing her out of the lock-down protocol.
May: There’s still another way, the way you two came in.
Coulson: Nobody knows about that except you, me, and now General Talbot.
May: Are you sure?
Coulson: Go check it out. Make sure it’s secure.
May: Come with me.
Talbot: I’m sorry, Phil, but I got to loop in the president.
Coulson: Give us some time. We’ll find him.
Lincoln: Another dead end. What’s going on?
Daisy: Fitz, he’s… he’s taken full control of the lock-down.
Lincoln: I’m trapped in here?
Daisy: Relax. I’ll get you out.
Lincoln: Yeah. Hopefully not in a body bag.
Fitz: I need the blue disc in port seven and gold disc in port four.
Mack: Could you use an extra hand?
Simmons: Mack.
Fitz: Uh, well, actually, I could use about seven, but one will do. I need you to put these in bay eight.
Simmons: Sorry.
Mack: Are we giving her the runaround, or is she giving it to us?
Fitz: I think it’s a bit of both. All right, rebooting in three, two, one. Okay. There’s no way he’s getting off this base unless he learns to fly.
Mack: Actually, Daisy could fly him out.
Simmons: She’s nowhere near here.
Mack: If she hacked into the Quinjet systems and reprogrammed them for autopilot, she could fly him out from anywhere in the world.
Fitz: Spent so much time trying to secure the base, I didn’t even think of the Quinjet. She’s locked us out.
Mack: Okay, I’m on it.
Lincoln: I’m in. Are we all clear up there?
Daisy: There’s a problem. I can’t access the camera on the upper deck. It may be having some issues.
Lincoln: I made it this far. I’m not stopping now.
Daisy: I won’t have eyes up there, Lincoln. You’ll be on your own.
Lincoln: Looks clear to me.
Mack: Can’t let you leave, Sparks.
Lincoln: Let me go. I got to get to Daisy.
Mack: You’re on a fool’s errand. The only reason she’s helping you is so Hive can make you one of them.
Lincoln: Mack, you don’t understand. I need to go.
Mack: I’ll keep your arms pinned down all day if I have to.
Lincoln: Don’t make me do this!
Daisy: Lincoln? Lincoln, are you there?
Lincoln: You still there?
Daisy: What happened? I lost you.
Lincoln: You didn’t lose me. Just a little complication. We’re good to go.
Daisy: Okay, get to one of the Quinjets, and I’ll do the rest.
Radcliffe: I-I don’t… It should’ve worked.
Hive: Remove your restraints.
James: Those are some nicely trained puppies. Bring me Dr. Radcliffe.
Radcliffe: Look, th-th-th-th-this is just science. I’m gonna have to look at the data before I can say for sure what really happened here. I know… I know the results are pretty unpleasant, but at least they didn’t completely melt this time. That’s… That’s a significant improvement. I’ll redouble my efforts for the beta test.
Hive: That won’t be necessary.
Radcliffe: Don’t kill me. Please. It’ll work next time. You have my word. If not, kill me then. I mean, of course, I’ll beg again, but…
Hive: Get up. These will do just fine.
Radcliffe: Are you serious? These Primitives are an abomination of science and a very poor reflection of my talents.
Hive: They are not abominations.
James: I’ve got to go with the Doc on this one. I mean, they’re some very ugly muffins.
Hive: They’re part of me and the Inhuman race. I want you to make more.
Radcliffe: Just one more test. There’s bound to be an improvment. More. Absolutely. How many?
Lincoln: This is QJ-6. Ready for takeoff.
Daisy: Copy that, QJ-6. I’ll see you in a few hours.
Lincoln: Just you and me? No one else?
Daisy: Just us, far away from everyone.
Elena: Mack.
Mack: Ohh. I’m thinking maybe I’m not the Inhuman whisperer.
Coulson: Lincoln?
Talbot: You run a tight ship, Coulson.
Daisy: He’s on his way.
Hive: Good. I’ll be there to greet him when he arrives. I know you feel bad about lying to him, though once he joins us, he’ll understand. Come. There’s something I want to show you.
Daisy: What happened to them?
Hive: They’re part of us. Our children, really, from our own flesh and blood, and we’re gonna make more of them. So we’ll need more blood.
Daisy: How much?
Hive: All of it.
Fitz: Daisy’s out of the system.
Talbot: That’s good news, because I’m gonna call the president and have that thing shot out of the sky.
Coulson: I’m afraid I can’t let you make that call.
Talbot: Are you threatening me after you just let him escape?
May: He didn’t escape.
Talbot: Well, if he wasn’t on that jet that just flew out of here, then who the hell was?
May: Desperate times, desperate measures.
Lincoln: We knew Daisy was listening and monitoring our every move, so we couldn’t tell anyone. She had to believe it was all real.
May: I communicated with him by leaving messages on his food trays.
Elena: Your forgot the message about not hurting his friend.
Lincoln: Sorry, Mack. I didn’t have any other option.
May: Mack wasn’t supposed to be there.
Mack: Excuse me for doing my job.
Lincoln: The plan depended on Daisy listening to everything so that she’d trust me and believe that I really wanted out.
Talbot: You had me fooled.
Lincoln: Even though I wanted to, I never trusted Daisy, not under Hive’s control. I knew that she wouldn’t be the one to greet me, no matter what she said.
Mack: But what about the other risks? Lash could kill Daisy. Did you stop to think about that?
Lincoln: It’s a risk we had to take. But he had the opportunity once before, and he let her go. I don’t think he’s meant to kill her.
Talbot: Who put him on the Quinjet?
May: I did while Coulson was keeping you distracted.
Talbot: You knew about this?
Coulson: I run a tight ship.
Talbot: Why do you think this Lash can defeat Hive? And who in tarnation names these things?
Lincoln: Every Inhuman is here for a reason and serves a purpose. I believe Lash’s purpose is to kill Hive.
Radcliffe: We’re being attacked by… I don’t know… some kind of a-a monster. You… You shouldn’t. You’ve lost a lot of blood. I strongly advise against that.
Daisy: Where’s James?
Radcliffe: He’s on a beer run. I suggest we do the same. Or at least the… the running part.
Daisy: Stay away from him.
Lash: Now you’re free.
Daisy: Ragtag base, come in. This is Agent Daisy Johnson. I’m coming home. Repeat. I’m coming home.
Coulson: Welcome back, Agent Johnson.
Lincoln: It’s good to see you.
Daisy: Lash died trying to save me.
Talbot: Did he manage to kill Hive?
Simmons: Get her to the med bay.
Fitz: Lash wasn’t here to kill Hive.
Lincoln: He was here to save Daisy.
Simmons: That wasn’t Lash.
Simmons: Prep for immediate blood transfusion and full cranial scan.
Talbot: How do we know this isn’t a trap? That she isn’t under Hive’s voodoo spell?
Coulson: We’ll know soon enough.
Mack: In the meantime, have a little faith.
Simmons: Daisy is completely sway free. Her brain is back to normal. But she is suffering withdrawal symptoms from the effects of the sway. It’ll take some time. She’s resting now, recovering from that and the blood loss, but we do expect a full recovery.
Coulson: Nobody goes in there until I say, but that’s good news. I know that look. That means there’s bad news, too. What is it?
Simmons: Dr. Fitz?
Fitz: Well, this is purely hypothetical, and there are a lot of unknown variables, but…
Simmons: Based on what Daisy told us about Hive’s new pathogen…
Fitz: We think we know what he plans to do with it. If he can create some short of shock wave, then Hive could potentially infect a significant percentage of the human race, turning them all into the swayed primitive Inhumans that Daisy described…
Simmons: If and only if he finds a way to disperse it high enough in the atmosphere.
Fitz: Yeah.
Talbot: He has a way. That thing he stole from the ATCU in Indiana. It was a warhead, a fully operational warhead.
Mack: It’s open. Elena.
Elena: Does this mean you see a future now?
Mack: Or I need a fast way out of here.
Elena: Daisy’s back. That’s a good thing, right?
Mack: Mm-hmm.
Elena: Do you still think we can’t win?
Mack: I don’t know, but I’m ready to stand and fight.
Elena: Give me your hands. Close your eyes. Don’t open them until I leave. Keep the faith, Alphonso Mackenzie.
