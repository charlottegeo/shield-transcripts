Man 1 (in Spanish): Everyone stay put until the threat is assessed.
Woman (in Spanish): What’s going on?
Man 2 (in Spanish): They want the guns.
Woman (in Spanish): OUr vehicle is under attack!
Man 1 (in Spanish): You’re outnumbered. Come out with your hands up.
Man (in Spanish): Take cover!
May: This can’t be easy.
Coulson: It’s fine.
May: Can I ask, why here?
Coulson: I want him to see where it happened. Besides, I wasn’t about to give him the location of our base. And apparently, he didn’t want to invite us to his house.
Man: All clear.
Coulson: Mr. President.
President: Director Coulson. Thank you for meeting me. Long overdue. Rosalind spoke highly of you. She believed that I should be working with S.H.I.E.L.D. I did always value her judgment. I’ll miss her.
Coulson: I assume we’re not here to share memories of a fallen friend.
President: This… this problem… Rosalind said you called them Inhumans? Heads of state calling, not sure what’s happening. Watchdog agencies hurling accusations. Fox News won’t shut up. I don’t need to tell you how delicate the situation is, but we have to do something.
Coulson: With all due respect, Mr. President, we are doing something.
Joey (in Spanish): We’ve been notified that the alien contagion may have spread here, that there’s been a recent incident.
Man (in Spanish): I’ll get my supervisor.
Daisy: You’re doing good.
Joey: I’m not great at projecting authority. It’s nice to talk Spanish, though. Reminds me of home.
Daisy: Do you miss it?
Joey: Especially Sundays. Mom cooks on Sundays. And you? You have people?
Daisy: Sort of. Not really.
Ramon: Colonel Ramon. I speak English, if it makes this easier.
Daisy: It does. Thank you.
Ramon: This way to my office.
Daisy: We’re following up a report. Your officers were attacked by a powered assailant?
Ramon: Yes. We’re already overwhelmed by the guns, drugs, and kidnappings, and now these things. Are they really aliens?
Daisy: It’s a little bit more complicated than that. But like everyone else, there are good ones and bad ones.
Ramon: But when they are bad, we are powerless to stop them. That convoy was loaded with weapons that were supposed to help us fight whatever this is. And now weapons are gone.
Daisy: But we’re here. We’ve got a team on the ground, and we’re here to help.
President: I don’t know how it is that your agency still exists, nor do I want to know, but I appreciate your help.
Coulson: Does that mean you’re reauthorizing S.H.I.E.L.D.?
President: The public has a short memory but not that short. The image of Helicarriers crashing down on the nation’s capital is hard to forget.
Coulson: Then why is this meeting happening if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t exist?
President: Because I need you to keep doing what you’re doing. Privately. Publicly, the ATCU will still be the face of my administration’s response to advanced threats. I’ll appoint a new head to the agency, one who understands they answer to you.
Coulson: So we’re your black-ops response.
President: Isn’t black ops where you feel most comfortable?
Coulson: I certainly prefer it to bureaucracy. Okay, then. We’ll keep doing what we do, and you’ll keep pretending we don’t exist.
President: Exactly.
Coulson: One last thing. Gideon Malick.
President: I can’t help you.
Coulson: He ordered this hit. He’s HYDRA.
President: Even if you can prove any of that, Gideon Malick has a stake in almost every country’s economy. He advises world leaders, he served on the World Council, he spent a lifetime and a fortune building influence. I can’t pull that thread.
Coulson: But you can let him walk free? Rosalind bled to death right here.
President: Malick may have blood on his hands, but my hands are tied. Yours are not.
Coulson: Is there any intel you’re willing to give?
President: Never spent enough time with the man to get in his head. Listen, I’m aware of your sacrifices. I thank you for your service. I’ll be in touch when I’ve named a new head to the ATCU.
Man: We’re on the move.
May: Sorry he didn’t give you an angle to go at Malick.
Coulson: Actually, he may have.
Mack: I’ve seen this before. Protests in Beirut.
Hunter: Urban rioting 101. Child’s play compared to the real issue. Powers, wrong hands, again.
Mack: This could be something.
Hunter: An entire armory’s worth of military might nicked from a police van, right under the nose of the police in less than four minutes. The two of us, trained, experienced. We can pull this off. But all it takes is one tainted fish taco, and pff. Unfair advantage, really.
Mack: Transmission starting now.
Hunter: No offense intended.
Lincoln: Yeah, no, it’s great, being hunted, feared. It’s a blast.
Simmons: Metal scraping on an urban street. A million and one possibilities. Fitz? I hate to bother you, but is there something I’m not seeing?
Fitz: No. You’re right. It’s, um, inconclusive.
Mack: Copy that.
Morse: So, as far as the police on the scene believe, whoever attacked them was invisible.
Mack: Well, we’ve seen weirder.
Hunter: Invisibility. Imagine the possibilities.
Morse: What are you imagining?
Hunter: Nothing fun.
Morse: Get used to it. We can’t put the Terrigen genie back in the bottle. Powers are the new normal.
Mack: I think you’re just jealous.
Hunter: Damn right I am. Tell me you didn’t try one of those little fish-oil pills. I had my fingers crossed for x-ray vision. I was just curious. I wasn’t the only one.
Morse: I mean, I-I thought about it. I didn’t actually do it. Rehab was a bitch.
Mack: Man, you two deserve each other. Let’s fan out, cover more ground.
Mack: Pretty nifty magic trick you did there.
Mack: You’d think three years’ high school Spanish… All right, all right. Don’t do anything stupid. We’re just here to…
Daisy: How do you lose someone as big as Mack?
Hunter: I don’t know. Same way one loses a truckload of weapons.
Morse: Good thing a grocery store down the street is security-conscious. Here we go.
Daisy: Who’s he looking at?
Hunter: W-what did we just watch?
Daisy: How accelerated, exactly?
Simmons: Approximately 6 meters in a thirtieth of a second that one frame of video is exposed. So, very.
Daisy: Well, catching her won’t be easy.
Simmons: I’ll reconfigure the containment module, if we can even get her in there.
Daisy: Thanks.
Lincoln: So, you do that remotely?
Simmons: Exactly. The poly-tectic material then adapts to the powers we’re dealing with. A necessity since Inhuman powers are so random.
Lincoln: Not true.
Simmons: I’m sorry?
Lincoln: Powers aren’t random. We were taught that each is given to fill an evolutionary need at the time.
Simmons: Are you being serious?
Lincoln: To create equilibrium within the species. Yin yang and all that. At least, that’s what we were taught.
Simmons: Huh. An actual intelligent design.
Fitz: Oh. Uh, sir, I think you’re gonna be pretty…
Coulson: Stop what you’re doing. Come with me. What do you think of Mr. Campbell?
Fitz: Lincoln? Smart. Obviously most helpful in helping us, Jemma, Understand Inhuman biology. And it’s been good for keeping her busy, focusing on something else. Things still feel different, though. But how could they not after what I did to Will?
Coulson: You did what you had to do. We both did. Sometimes there’s no choice but the hard choice. That’s the job. Now set up the machine.
Fitz: Sir, you’re not really think…
Coulson: It’s not for me. There’s one person who might have information about Gideon Malick. I need to get into his head.
Elena (in Spanish): Now don’t hesitate. We get rid of the problem today.
Francisco (in Spanish): You should be there.
Elena (in Spanish): I’ll deal with the complication in the bathroom. Call me when it’s done.
Elena (in Spanish): Why are you in Bogotá?
Mack: Been waiting for you to come back.
Mack: So you snap back to the same spot like a yo-yo. Good to know. How about you let me… Aah! Damn it! I’m starting to hate you.
Simmons: Von Strucker’s in a persistent vegetative state. Significant portions of his brain are damaged. Sir, I’m not sure what you want to do is even possible.
Coulson: Let’s find out. It’s worth a shot if it gets us closer to Malick.
Giyera: We were alerted to a police report, Bogota, Colombia. I’ve dispatched a team.
Malick: We need to replace our losses. Dr. Garner did a lot of damage, and our guest needs Inhumans. You have doubts.
Giyera: He can barely stand, doesn’t speak.
Malick: Because he spent hundreds of years clinging to life, trying to survive on the few men we were able to sacrifice every few decades. But I’m not a fool. Keep your eyes open. I don’t want my faith to be misplaced.
Man: Sir, he’s asking for you.
Malick: He spoke?
Malick: How can I help you? What do you need?
Hive: I’m hungry.
Mack: Chair’s an upgrade. Least there’s that.
Elena (in Spanish): I don’t know what you’re saying.
Mack: Yeah, again, I don’t know what you’re saying.
Elena (in Spanish): Are you U.S. military? I know you’re not with the local police.
Mack: Policía? Yeah. You stole pistolas from the policia and sold the pistolas to your amigos, criminals.
Elena (in Spanish): Me? I’m the criminal?
Mack: Yeah, you. Whoosh, whoosh. Criminal.
Elena (in Spanish): I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t use my gifts to commit a sin. They’re a gift from God.
Mack: Dios? You think God did this?
Elena: Sí. Dios.
Mack: You think it was a gift from Dios or pescado?
Elena: Pescado?
Mack: Yeah, fish. I know my way around a menu.
Elena (in Spanish): That’s what I was eating for dinner when… whateever that was, happened. It felt like rock crawling on my body… Suffocating me in it.
Mack: I think you’re talking about Terrigenesis.
Elena: Terrigenesis?
Mack: Yeah. You’re an alien. My partner’s one, too. You’ll see her soon enough.
Daisy: Thank God.
Morse: Hey, you.
Hunter: Her?
Mack: Don’t make me crush you.
Lincoln: So, this recovers lost memories?
Simmons: But it’s a dangerous procedure on a healthy subject.
Fitz: And Werner’s anything but.
Lincoln: Anoxic brain trauma. Prefrontal cortex is barely active.
Simmons: But memories are backed up in other areas, as well, traces and images tucked throughout the brain.
Fitz: Just need to dig them out.
Coulson: You have a problem with this? Because I do. I’ve been in this thing twice. Getting my arm cut off was pleasant by comparison. But they’re telling me Gideon Malick is untouchable. I won’t accept that. We good to go?
Simmons: Yes, sir.
Coulson: Werner, I need your help. Concentrate on Gideon Malick.
Strucker: Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me! Just kill me! No, just kill me! Just kill me!
Daisy: She’ll wake up soon, and when she does, I want you to run point on intake.
Joey: What do we know about her? Other than the kidnapping and the gun-running.
Mack: She works a clerical job at a museum. At night, art classes.
Hunter: Artist turned gun-runner. Kind of sexy.
Morse: No record.
Mack: It doesn’t add up.
Hunter: She got powers. That’s how it adds up. Andrew was a lovely head shrinker before he turned into a not-so-lovely Inhuman serial killer.
Mack: Point made.
Daisy: Fair enough.
Morse: Mack, is this the accomplice that you mentioned?
Mack: Yeah. Yeah, that’s him.
Morse: Her cousin. Lives by her. Also no record.
Joey: Why are they taking those weapons?
Morse: Hunter and I will go track them down.
Daisy: You’re up.
Daisy: She’s feisty.
Mack: Yeah, she’s not happy to be locked in there. I guess the shoe’s on the other foot.
Daisy: You’re enjoying this.
Mack: Mm. Maybe a little.
Giyera: You trying to regain strength? You were hurt pretty bad.
Hive: The body was dead. I was dying. They have advanced, but they haven’t changed.
Giyera: “They?”
Hive: Humans. But you’re not human anymore, are you? You don’t believe I am what they say. Once I’m strong enough, you will.
Strucker: Just kill me! Just kill me! Just kill me! Just kill me! Just kill me!
May: This isn’t working.
Simmons: He’s stuck in a memory of trauma. We can’t snap him out of it.
Strucker: Just kill me!
Coulson: I know what that’s like.
Strucker: Just kill me! Just kill me!
Coulson: What about him?
Strucker: Just kill me.
Lincoln: Me?
Coulson: Neurons communicate using electrical impulses. You could stimulate other areas of his brain.
Simmons: Targeted electroshock.
Lincoln: Hell no. I’m not doing that.
Simmons: Well, at the very least, it could jolt him out of this loop.
Lincoln: Or fry his cerebrum.
Coulson: He’s suffering. You could help snap him out of it.
Strucker: Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me.
Simmons: It’s working.
Coulson: Tell me about Gideon Malick.
Malick: I’ll handle everything.
Strucker: He sold me out. You sold me out.
Coulson: Before he sold you out, you reached him. How?
Strucker: You sold me out!
Coulson: Tell me how.
Strucker: Dad said only as a last resort. Perizad sent me. We went to Princeton together.
Strucker: No. I was afraid. I didn’t have anywhere else to turn. I didn’t know where else to turn.
Coulson: And now we do.
Joey (in Spanish): We’re trying to protect you from the world.
Elena (in Spanish): Didn’t ask for your help. Don’t need it.
Joey (in Spanish): Well, in this case, we’re defending the world from you.
Elena (in Spanish): I knew it. You’re wirking with them.
Mack: Tell her S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t really with anyone. We’re sort of our own thing.
Mack: She said her powers were a gift from God.
Elena (in Spanish): Yes. To finally do something. To end injustice, instead of accepting the way things have always been.
Daisy: I think we were wrong about her.
Mack: Ask her about the convoy. Why’d she take those weapons?
Joey (in Spanish): The weapons you stole, what are you going to use them for?
Elena (in Spanish): We are not going to use them.
Morse (in Spanish): Don’t move!
Elena (in Spanish): We’re making sure no one uses them.
Daisy: But they belong to the police.
Elena (in Spanish): Know what we call the police here?
Joey: Thieves in uniform.
Elena (in Spanish): They are only powerful because they have guns. Now I have actual power. To protect my friends from being arrested… killed in the streets. And you want to take it away.
Morse: Found him. He was dumping weapons into the river.
Daisy: She’s telling the truth.
Morse: We’ve got visitors. Local law enforcement.
Daisy: Okay, well, be careful. Not everyone’s on this side of the law. We’re on our way.
Morse: Stay with him?
Ramon: What’s going on here?
Morse: We’ve got this. World Health Organization jurisdiction.
Ramon: You don’t really expect me to just drive away, do you?
Morse: Guess not. It would’ve been easier if you had.
Ramon (in Spanish): Bring them to the station. Let’s figure out who they’re working for.
Lucio (in Spanish): And him?
Ramon (in Spanish): We’ll use him to send a message.
Daisy: Hunter and Bobbi were gone by the time we got there.
Mack: Elena’s cousin. The police just left him there.
Daisy: I need to tell Coulson what’s going on.
Joey: I haven’t seen a lot of dead bodies, but is that normal?
Mack: No, it’s too soon for rigor mortis to set in, but, maybe they have another kind of weapon.
Joey: An Inhuman?
Mack: I don’t see how Bobbi and Hunter were taken otherwise.
Joey: Elena has been asking about him.
Mack: I’m sorry.
Morse: Hunter? Are you okay?
Hunter: It hurts.
Morse: Yeah. Pain means it’s wearing off.
Hunter: Ugh. Bloody powers.
Ramon: Good afternoon, beautiful. I need you to answer questions. His fate depends on your answers. Why are you really here?
Mack: Uh, Joey’s here to, um… Here’s the thing. It’s not something I talk about, but like you, I rely on my faith. And somehow, I never made the connection till you said it, but… maybe these powers, these gifts that you have, that Daisy has, maybe they’re not random. Maybe it’s part of a plan.
Elena (in Spanish): I believe I have a duty, to use these gifts, to do better.
Joey: She believes she’s meant to do good with these gifts.
Mack: We believe the same thing. We need to help each other, to stop them.
Joey: She’s in.
Daisy: How do your powers work?
Joey: It’s connected to her pulse.
Mack: What does that mean? What’s the radius on her powers?
Joey: As far as she can go in one heartbeat.
Daisy: You’re my new best friend.
Mack: Okay. Here. Two figures, not moving but alive. Assuming Bobbi and Hunter. The other figures moving in the station, assume bad guys.
Daisy: One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.
Mack: To that end…
Mack: At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
Daisy: Joey, you seeing this?
Joey: Mm-hmm.
Daisy: Take care of it.
Ramon: Why did you even come here?
Morse: We’re part of an alien task force. There’s an invasion happening of powered people, like, Medusa eyes over there. Like I said, alien invasion.
Daisy: Okay, you grab the weapons, and I’ll… or you do that.
Morse: Maybe you should make a run for it. Mack, you need to warn the others.
Mack: The Inhuman. The power’s in his eyes!
Daisy: No, Elena, don’t!
Daisy: His glasses.
Joey: Elena!
Coulson: Perizad sent me. We went to Princeton together.
Man: Hold, please.
Malick: Werner?
Coulson: No, he’s in no shape to make phone calls these days. You made sure of that, if I’m talking to Gideon Malick. I’ll take that as a yes. Phil Coulson here.
Malick: Is this about Rosalind Price? The man who took her is gone.
Coulson: As will be everything you value. It’s started to unravel, hasn’t it? Your portal gone, the Inhumans you stockpiled murdered. It wasn’t easy to get this number, but this call will cost you. We’re tracking this line everywhere it connects.
Malick: It’ll cost me millions, to be sure. I’ll have to shut down a few offices, but don’t get too far ahead of yourself, Mr. Coulson. My influence reaches a little bit farther than that.
Daisy: We’ll configure the module to hold him, and get Bobbi, Elena, and Hunter to medical.
Joey: What is that?
Mack: HYDRA.
Elena (in Spanish): I’m not going anywhere.
Joey (in Spanish): You’ll learn how to use your powers.
Elena (in Spanish): I already figured that out.
Joey (in Spanish): Things are different now. You are an Inhuman.
Elena (in Spanish): I’m also Colombian. And an office manager and a daughter and a cousin… I have to take my cousin home. I have to tell my aunt why he died.
Daisy: She’s not wrong.
Joey (in Spanish): I know it’s hard… but you’ll do good with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Elena (in Spanish): I’m doing good. Close to home.
Mack: She’s a perfect fit for this team you’re trying to build.
Daisy: Except for the pesky little fact she doesn’t want any part of it.
Mack: Look, she’s also vulnerable out there. Might be a good thing, keeping her close. It’s safer. Don’t look at me like that.
Daisy: Is it safer? Four of us in one place makes us vulnerable, like the 12 Inhumans Lash killed.
Mack: It’s hard to build a team if everyone’s spread over the world.
Daisy: When I was a hacker, my team and I, we were tight, and we weren’t on the same continent.
Mack: Huh. Yeah, with the right tech solution, it could work.
Daisy: Let’s hope the Director agrees.
Mack: If we need backup, or if you do, we’re a tap away.
Elena: Backup. I’m… I’m sorry for kidnapping you.
Mack: I’ll see you soon. Yo-Yo.
Elena: Goodbye, Mack.
Mack: Goodbye.
Daisy: How about you? Maybe you don’t have to miss dinner this Sunday.
Simmons: When did you get done?
Fitz: Uh, earlier today. I think he’s gonna like this one. How are you? Must be fascinating getting to know all about Inhuman DNA…
Simmons: I miss you. There it is. I miss you.
Fitz: I’m here. Together. We’re…
Simmons: Professional and matter of fact, and there’s this chasm in the middle of the room of all these things, of our kiss and Will’s death, and…
Fitz: And I’m sorry about that, Jemma, because… because maybe there was another way… and there was something else that I could’ve done.
Simmons: Will died saving me. What you did was kill a thing, a monster. You’ve been nothing less than extraordinary this whole time.
Fitz: So, um… about this… chasm, as you call it.
Simmons: Can we start over, back to where we began?
Fitz: 16 and achingly shy.
Simmons: Two people, endlessly inquisitive, about to embark on a relationship that will change their lives, but they don’t know where it will go. I’m Jemma Simmons, biochemist.
Fitz: Leopold Fitz, engineering.
Daisy: Hey, you.
Lincoln: Welcome back. So, I just ran into Joey, packing up.
Daisy: Yeah. You think I’m making a mistake?
Lincoln: Letting him live a normal life like everyone else? No, you’re not.
Daisy: No, I mean offering you the same deal. Your APB’s been lifted. No one’s looking for you. You could go back to your old life if you want.
Lincoln: I don’t know. It’s pretty interesting here.
Daisy: I was hoping you’d say that.
May: You’re trusting them more.
Coulson: It’s good to delegate.
May: So it’s not because you don’t trust yourself. It looks good.
Coulson: Fitz outdid himself on this one. Lots of bells and whistles. It’s pretty fantastic.
May: May I? Feels real.
Coulson: Feels like the others. It’s not the hand. It’s me.
May: Maybe you’re not supposed to get over it. Some things you can’t move past. They scar you, change you permanently.
Coulson: I don’t know what happened there, on that planet.
May: I do. You joined the cavalry.
Man: In a surprising move, Gothite Industry closed 10 offices today. Their stock prices continue to tumble as investor react. Gideon Malick cannot be reached for comment.
May: Sometimes you’re wounded, sometimes you wound.
Coulson: But he’s still collecting Inhumans.
May: Any theories as to why?
Coulson: Lincoln said Inhuman powers create a balance for the species, an equilibrium. We got a lot of heroes on our side. Makes me wonder what Malick has on his.
Malick: Did we get the Inhuman?
Giyera: The doctors are with him now, but they say his powers are strong.
Malick: At least we get some good news today.
Hive: You want to believe, but you don’t know if you can.
Malick: Coulson survived. Could be you’re not who I thought you were.
Hive: You’ll believe, once I make a believer out of him.
President: It makes perfect sense to name him the head of the ATCU. He knows all the players, the public respects military authority. You’ve worked together.
Coulson: I wouldn’t exactly call it “together.”
President: He has the utmost respect for you.
Coulson: Now I know you’re lying.
President: Remember, he’ll be taking orders from you.
Coulson: And I’m sure he’s thrilled about that.
President: I’m confident this will work out, Coulson.
Coulson: Mr. President. Oh, boy.
