Price: Two all-Americans from D.J.’s extra bacon, double cheese.
Coulson: Is it me, or is every burger that’s named “the all-American” just really awful for you?
Price: Oh, don’t be a hater, Phil.
Coulson: Half Moon pub. Isn’t that where we had our first drink?
Price: I go there a lot.
Coulson: Of course you do.
Price: Yeah, it’s not like it’s a memento or anything.
Coulson: Just matches. Got it.
Price: You know, Banks thinks I’m crazy to keep seeing you like this. Oh.
Coulson: Huh. You told Banks about us?
Price: Yeah, I tell Banks everything.
Coulson: Hmm. I didn’t realize you two were so chummy.
Price: Well, there’s a lot you don’t know about me, even after sneaking two of your agents into my workplace.
Coulson: Just to say it, technically, I was right to do that. You are working for HYDRA. And also… I’m sorry.
Price: Any sensible girl would swipe left in this moment.
Coulson: Honestly, don’t know what that means.
Price: You’re such a luddite.
Coulson: You know I have a flying car, right?
Price: Uh, yeah. It’s from the ‘60s.
Coulson: I’m glad we’re finally having burgers.
Price: Me, too. So, your team find anything new about Malick?
Coulson: Nothing we didn’t already know. D.C. power player with his hand in almost every government organization.
Price: Yeah, including mine.
Coulson: Where he somehow managed to remove every Inhuman you had in custody. Thank you.
Price: Wait, you think Malick’s mobilizing?
Coulson: Only question is why.
Price: Not sure. That’s what I intend to find out.
Coulson: You’re going back into the ATCU? I can’t protect you on the inside.
Price: Thanks, Lancelot, but I’ll be just fine. The ATCU, it’s my turf. And as far as Malick’s concerned, I’m just clocking in another day at work.
Coulson: Still a dangerous play.
Price: Well, then that’s a risk I have to take. I mean, look, it’s my people that Malick’s been using as lab rats, and I’m the idiot who’s been working under HYDRA this entire time.
Coulson: “Idiot” is a little harsh. So what’s the plan once you’re in?
Price: Just another day. But I scheduled a meeting with Malick, and that way…
Coulson: Roz? Rosalind? No, no! Oh, no. Stay with my voice. Stay with me, Roz. Listen, stay with the sound of my voice! Look at me, right here! Roz! Roz! I need you to breathe! Please, Roz! Look at me! Breathe! Roz! Breathe. Please breathe. Please breathe. Please, just stay with me. Please stay with me.
Ward: Now you know how it feels, Coulson, to watch someone you care for bleed out right in front of you.
Coulson: Ward?
Ward: Got to admit, it still sounds funny when you don’t say “agent” first.
Coulson: What did you do?
Ward: It seems I just eliminated a leak at the ATCU.
Coulson: You murdered Rosalind to keep her from digging into Malick?
Ward:  Come on, Coulson. You really think Rosalind was gonna stop Malick from opening another portal? He’s opened one before. I’m sure he’ll do it again. No. This is personal. S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps sending its best agents to kill me. Thought I’d stop that from happening again by taking out the guy who keeps sending them.
Coulson: Want to take me out? Come and get me. We’ll settle this right now.
Ward: I have people who take care of that sort of thing for me now. No, I just wanted to hear the panic in your voice before you died.
Coulson: This isn’t over.
Man: He’s outside!
Mack: Get down!
Coulson: Go, go, go!
Mack: What about Ms. Price?
Coulson: Just drive.
May: Let him go.
Morse: Coulson said anything once you got him out of there?
Mack: He just told me to get the interrogation room ready.
May: I’m so sorry, Phil. Whatever you need, just ask.
Coulson: We start at the beginning. How does Ward think? Is there any weakness we haven’t exploited yet?
May: You really think there’s something we’ve missed?
Coulson: There’s only one way to find out. I want each of the original team members to tell me everything they remember about Ward, down to the smallest detail, no matter how uncomfortable.
May: Okay.
Coulson: When you two were sleeping together, did he ever confess any personal details?
May: We didn’t do much talking.
Coulson: How was your relationship with Ward after he saved your life?
Simmons: I was grateful.
Coulson: Just grateful?
Fitz: Once, I caught him alone in my bunk, like some sort of creeper.
Coulson: Was he stealing?
Fitz: Uh, no. I don’t think so. But he was, um, just sitting there, staring at a picture of me and my mum.
May: Ward appealed because he was damaged.
Coulson: Did he ever open up about what had hurt him?
May: Like I said, not much talking. But whatever it was seemed to drive him. Made him desperate for others to think of him as some kind of hero.
Fitz: He and I, we were like brothers, at least, that’s what it felt like at the time. Then I realized he was just using me.
Coulson: Using you for what?
Fitz: It’s hard to describe, really, but it was like… like he was trying to replace something that had gone missing.
Simmons: I was such a pathetic flirt, always laughing at his jokes and those ridiculous puns.
Coulson: You were attracted to him.
Simmons: Well, he did jump out of a plane to save me.
Coulson: Ever think the feeling might’ve been mutual?
Simmons: That’s not what Ward needed from me. Besides, it was obvious he fancied someone else.
Daisy: I don’t know what to say.
Coulson: Then just answer the questions.
Daisy: Sure. But I doubt there’s anything you don’t already know.
Coulson: I’ve heard all about how Ward fell for you. Now explain to me how you fell for him.
Mack: I realize this has got to be hard on you.
Banks: I just want to get the guy who took Roz out.
Mack: So do we. Which is why there are a couple of people I need you to meet.
Daisy: There was just something about him. We both had these messed-up childhoods. Made it easy to relate.
Coulson: Have you considered that all of that might’ve been an act to get close, that maybe he found a weakness and exploited it?
Daisy: It wasn’t an act. For whatever reason, Ward never lied to me. He just hid parts of himself that I wasn’t ready to see yet.
Coulson: Yet?
Daisy: When you grew up like we did, it… it impacts how you see the world. Everything is filtered through a very specific lens. And Ward got that. That’s why he thought he could make me understand him.
Coulson: Was he right?
Daisy: Probably. After years of moving from place to place, I totally get how easy it was for him to be taken in by a powerful father figure. I even understand how Garrett was able to draw him into HYDRA. It’s not like I wasn’t fooled by my mom when she…
Coulson: Sounds like there’s a lot you’re willing to forgive.
Daisy: I will never forgive him. He murdered Rosalind just to hurt you. He killed Koenig… He killed Koenig because of me.
Coulson: He knew once Koenig outed him as HYDRA, he’d lose you.
Daisy: And the sad part is, that’s when I finally understood him for the first time. The reason Ward kills isn’t because he feels nothing. It’s because he feels too much.
Mack: Ward mentioned that Malick’s trying to open a portal.
Fitz: Does this look familiar?
Banks: Yeah, that’s Distant Star Pathfinder. It was the program NASA was in the middle of when Roz and I… joined. We weren’t privy to the details.
Mack: You know where NASA was running it?
Banks: They weren’t. An independent contractor proposed the project, ran things out of a lab complex. Facility shut down years ago.
Simmons: Maybe worth looking anyway. Do we have to guess who it was that funded this independent contractor?
Banks: No, you don’t. It was Gideon Malick.
Malick: All hail the conquering hero. That was fast. Seems I just gave the go-ahead.
Ward: Been a while since I took a shot from that far out. Felt good.
Malick: Yeah, I bet. Guess in all that excitement, you forgot about the part where we need Phil Coulson alive.
Ward: He made it out.
Malick: By the skin of his teeth. What the hell were you thinking about, sending in your little bones brigade?
Ward: I wanted to put Coulson through his paces.
Malick: Ah. This is not some game you just leave to chance.
Ward: Well, maybe not for you. I was good either way.
Malick: Right. ‘Cause if Coulson doesn’t make it out, you get that closure you’ve been searching for. Closure’s not something that I ever put much stock in. What I believe in, is moving forward. Never looking back. These five stones were extracted from the monolith centuries ago. The idea was that they should be divided up evenly among HYDRA’s most powerful leaders.
Ward: Now you’ve got the full set, thanks to me.
Malick: You’re missing the point. These stones are the key to everything that HYDRA’s been marching toward since it was formed. And now you’re jeopardizing all of that for something as petty as closure.
Ward: Don’t worry. Everything will play out exactly like we planned.
Malick: How can you be so sure?
Ward: ‘Cause I know Coulson better than he knows himself.
Hunter: Sir, I just wanted to say…
Morse: Sir!
Coulson: You were supposed to take Ward out. I sent you to do a job. You failed! Now people are dead.
Morse: You need to calm down!
Hunter: Ward should never have had the chance to do what he did.
Coulson: No. She’s right. I’m the one who picked Ward for this team. Everything that happened since, it’s on me.
Hunter: Sir, I’d do anything to have another shot at the bastard.
Coulson: Well, you better not miss this time.
Hunter: This time?
Coulson: I figured out a way to track down Ward, but we got to go off book.
Hunter: My specialty.
Morse: I’m not sure taking Hunter is really such a good idea.
Coulson: You’re going, too, Agent Morse. We need a pilot.
Mack: What are you thinking?
Coulson: It’s simple, Agent Mackenzie. To take Ward out, I need to cross some lines the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. shouldn’t cross.
Mack: Well, maybe those lines aren’t meant to be crossed.
Coulson: Maybe not, but this is happening.
Mack: What, you want me to fill in?
Coulson: As acting director until it’s finished.
Mack: Why not put May in charge?
Coulson: After everything that’s happened with Andrew, she’s not ready to lead. You’re the only one I trust who doesn’t have an axe to grind with Ward.
Mack: I was gonna check out the Distant Star facility with Fitz and Simmons.
Coulson: They’ve already gone. I sent them and a team with Agent Banks 20 minutes ago.
Mack: Well, maybe I should go.
Coulson: This isn’t a request. It’s an order. I need you to step up and do the damn job.
Mack: Does this mean you’re gonna tell me your plan?
Coulson: Absolutely not.
Simmons: Seems unlikely anything portal-related is still here.
Fitz: Don’t go jumping to conclusions just yet. We may still find something to help us bring back Will.
Simmons: We can’t bring him back.
Fitz: Jemma, we’ve already built the program to determine where the portal will open on Maveth. The only thing that’s left is getting to the other side.
Simmons: That’s not what I meant. It’s irresponsible of us to open another portal. HYDRA’s been searching for the thing on that planet for centuries.
Fitz: It’s an old wives tale Hydra moms tell their goblin babies.
Simmons: But I’ve seen it. It’s real.
Fitz: Yes, and so is Will, and he’s stuck there, and he needs our help.
Simmons: You don’t think I want to save him? That it’s not tearing me up inside? He saved my life, and… you know how I feel about him. But to put so many other lives in jeopardy would be selfish.
Fitz: It’s not selfish.
Fitz: Don’t do this.
Banks: It’s not me!
Giyera: Let’s go. Mr. Malick is waiting.
Coulson: Our target’s in a public place.
Hunter: Plenty of looky-loos, then, I imagine. You’re serious about all options being on the table?
Coulson: You got something particular in mind?
Hunter: Ever robbed a bank before?
Coulson: Can’t say that I have. Have you?
Hunter: Piece of advice, never trust a crooked jockey on a doped-up horse. My point is, I have an idea I think should work.
Coulson: Good, 'cause time’s a luxury we don’t have. Ward and Malick are already 10 steps ahead.
Ward: Don’t blame me. This was his idea.
Malick: Get them up. You know, my father used to say, “never send a boy to do a man’s job,” but it honestly never occurred to me that I should try sending a young woman. Tell me, Ms. Simmons, when you went through, did you see it? You didn’t tell me she was so feral.
Ward: It’s a new development.
Malick: The secrets you must have hiding in that pretty little head of yours, just waiting to be shared.
Fitz: Well, never gonna help you put another bloody portal.
Malick: Nobody’s asking you to. See, Hydra’s been opening one portal or another for centuries. And all it takes is a few stones and a building with just the right vibrational frequency.
Fitz: What’s all this about, then?
Malick: The other thing.
Simmons: They don’t know how to get back.
Malick: You really are a sharp cookie. Maybe now you’re ready to reveal the secret.
Simmons: Come a little closer and find out.
Malick: What about you?
Fitz: Piss off.
Malick: Any suggestions?
Ward: Split them up.
Mack: HYDRA’s taken Fitz and Simmons.
Daisy: How is that possible?
Mack: There was an ambush at the Distant Star facility.
Daisy: What about Banks and the others?
Mack: They didn’t make it.
Daisy: We got to get on Zephyr One and get there.
Mack: I don’t think that’s the right move.
Daisy: They took Fitz and Simmons.
Mack: I know that, but HYDRA’s long gone by now, and we can’t waste every resource we have chasing our own damn tail.
Daisy: It’s better than doing nothing.
Mack: I need to call Coulson.
Coulson: Director?
Mack: Sir, we have a situation. Fitz and Simmons have been kidnapped.
Coulson: What? By who?
Mack: By HYDRA, by the looks of it. Seems they knew we were coming.
Coulson: That’s why Ward mentioned the portal. He wanted us to go there.
Hunter: Does this mean we need to make a change of plans?
Coulson: No. It means this better work.
Hunter: Anyone need explaining what to do next?! We got no heroes here today, mate.
Thomas Ward: Oh, god. How’d you find me?
Simmons: I’m not afraid of you.
Ward: Got to say, I am impressed with this whole furiosa vibe you got going on.
Simmons: Please just shut up.
Ward: And sure, being trapped on another world might’ve had a lot to do with it, but I would like to think dropping you and Fitz 20,000 leagues under the sea really got the ball rolling.
Simmons: You really are the king idiot.
Ward: This can go a couple of different ways.
Simmons: Do your worst.
Ward: You see, that’s the problem right there. If you’d really gotten to know me, you’d know that I would never do anything to hurt you, Jemma. But I can’t say the same is true for him. Let me know if you change your mind.
Giyera: You want to see a trick?
Fitz: What have you… What… What have you done with Simmons?
Ward: Trust me, you really don’t want to know.
Fitz: I’ll kill you, you, psychopath!
Ward: Seems you’re still scared of me, Fitz. Don’t worry. I’m not gonna hurt you. There’s a much simpler way to make you talk.
Fitz: Leave Simmons alone.
Ward: The first thought I had when we met was, “Wow, this guy’s really carrying a torch.” It was sweet, really. Not, uh, adult sweet. More like a cartoon puppy dog with its heart beating outside its chest.
Fitz: Don’t do this.
Ward: I even told you to make a move before it was too late. Guess what, too late.
Fitz: Please.
Ward: Just tell me how she came back, and this all ends. Simple as that.
Simmons: No! No! Nooo!
Ward: Or we can just sit here and listen.
Morse: You really think he can lead us to Ward?
Coulson: What I realized about Ward is that every twisted thing he does is just a misguided attempt to justify his past. But there’s one thing in his past he can never make right.
Thomas Ward: What is this? Did my brother send you?
Hunter: Grant Ward? Doesn’t even know you’re here, mate.
Coulson: But he’s about to.
Ward: I’m curious which is worse for you, those moments when Simmons screams or is it the long pauses when she doesn’t?
Ward: Wasn’t expecting a call from a dead woman’s phone.
Coulson: I spent every second since you murdered Rosalind trying to understand just how your sick mind works.
Ward: Shouldn’t be that hard. We’re not that different, you and me. It’s not like we operate in different worlds, Coulson. We both got blood on our hands.
Coulson: Big difference is, I’ve never hurt anyone for selfish reasons. That is, until now.
Ward: What’s that supposed to mean?
Coulson: There’s someone here who’d like to say hello. Take a look.
Ward: I got two of yours, so you take one of mine? Like I said, two sides, same coin. Only I doubt you’re willing to take it all the way.
Coulson: I thought you might say that, so I brought a friend along.
Ward: If you lay a finger on Thomas…
Hunter: Hanging up? Are you sure that was the right play, boss?
Coulson: I need Ward to know that we’ve got the upper hand. Plus, it’ll really piss him off.
Morse: Here.
Thomas Ward: Please don’t kill me.
Morse: Nobody wants that.
Thomas Ward: That’s not very reassuring when he’s got a gun to your head.
Hunter: Hate to break it to you, but your brother isn’t a very nice guy.
Thomas Ward: You’re the one who just kidnapped me. What’s wrong with you people?
Coulson: Ward hurt someone I care about. And as far as we can tell, you’re the only thing left in this world that he cares about, which means you’re the only way I can draw him out.
Thomas Ward: Okay. But you better finish him off when you do.
Hunter: Honestly wasn’t expecting that.
Thomas Ward: It’s what Grant’s always done, hurt people and lie to himself about it.
Hunter: So all that talk about a traumatic childhood is just rubbish, then?
Thomas Ward: I’m sure whatever he told you about our parents is true. See, my dad, he had some real anger issues, and my mom, well, she had dad issues, so they spent most of their time taking those issues out on us.
Morse: What about your brothers? Were you close?
Thomas Ward: Christian was a lot older, so we never really hung out much, but Grant, he was my best friend. Protected me from mom and dad, from Christian. And one day, he didn’t.
Coulson: The day he pushed you down the well.
Thomas Ward: Grant totally changed after that. It was like he felt guilty but couldn’t admit what had really happened. Instead, he kept promising never to let anyone hurt me again.
Hunter: Slightly unnerving coming from the guy who just chucked you down a well.
Morse: You two keep in touch? Family reunions, holidays, that sort of thing?
Thomas Ward: Grant was 17 when he burned my parents’ house down, with Christian inside. Ever since, I’ve made sure to give him a pretty wide berth.
Hunter: Pretty sound logic, actually.
Morse: Well, you don’t really seem like your brother.
Thomas Ward: Just 'cause you grow up in a family of abusive monsters doesn’t mean you have to become one. I didn’t. Please, don’t hand me over to Grant.
Hunter: Sorry, mate. Giving you up is the only way to draw him out.
Morse: Maybe not. During the call, I put a trace on Ward’s phone. Now we just have to keep him on long enough to get an exact location.
Coulson: Ward’ll never let that happen.
Thomas Ward: He will if I’m on the other end. Let me talk to him.
Hunter: Not a good idea, even if he does… call back. Still not a good idea.
Ward: I swear I’ll cut Fitz from head to toe if…
Thomas Ward: Grant?
Ward: Thomas. You okay?
Thomas Ward: Is everything they’re saying true?
Ward: Don’t listen to them. They’re the bad guys. They killed someone I love very much.
Thomas Ward: Then why is this happening?
Ward: They know how much I care about you. They want to hurt me.
Thomas Ward: It’s been almost 15 years.
Ward: I tried to see you. Mom and dad made that impossible. They kept you hidden.
Thomas Ward: That wasn’t mom and dad. That was me. I changed my name and moved so you’d never find me.
Ward: Why would you do that?
Thomas Ward: 'Cause I didn’t want to let you hurt me again.
Ward: That was one time.
Thomas Ward: Really? One time? Then explain what the hell you did to mom and dad.
Ward: Thomas.
Thomas Ward: No, you killed them. And Christian, too.
Ward: You know what type of people they were. They hurt us both. I couldn’t let that happen again.
Thomas Ward: Dad needed a walker to get around. Who was he gonna hurt?
Ward: I know this is tough to hear, but sometimes, you got to do a bad thing for the right reasons.
Thomas Ward: Stop trying to justify what you did. Just stop. They were my parents, too. And yeah, they were horrible people, but you are so much worse. You set them on fire.
Ward: Thomas, calm down. Listen to me for a second.
Coulson: Time’s up.
Ward: Put Thomas back on the phone.
Coulson: Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.
Ward: You traced the call.
Coulson: And now I’m coming to put you down.
Ward: You will tell me everything I need to know right now. You understand me?! Do you?!
Simmons: No. No!
Hunter: Trace puts Ward in the Southwest of England.
Coulson: They’re at the castle where we brought Simmons back.
Hunter: Which would explain why he kidnapped her and Fitz.
Coulson: 'Cause Malick’s trying to open another portal.
Hunter: Best get there before that happens, then.
Thomas Ward: I spent my life staying off Grant’s radar. How am I supposed to stay safe now?
Morse: A security detail has been assigned to keep an eye on you.
Thomas Ward: Is that all an act? Or was he really gonna hurt me?
Morse: We’ll be in touch.
May: Daisy said you needed a word.
Mack: More like your opinion. I’ve been reading Andrew’s file on Lincoln. “A dangerous temperament that’s only been inflamed by recent events. It’s my professional opinion he should not be allowed in the proposed initiative.” What do you think?
May: I’m not even sure if that’s Andrew’s evaluation. Maybe it’s Lash. How are we supposed to know the difference?
Mack: That’s a live sat feed from the castle where Ward and Malick are holding Fitz-Simmons.
May: Looks like HYDRA has a couple of dozen troops.
Mack: The bigger problem is the heavy artillery, the surface-to-air missiles. And that’s not even the worst of it. Coulson told him he was coming.
May: Cloaking won’t help if Hydra knows what to look for.
Mack: I asked him if he needed backup, but Coulson refused to make the call.
May: You’re the man in charge. Make it for him.
Mack: We’re outmanned, outgunned, with no time to mount an assault with even a snowball’s chance against a fortified HYDRA. What the hell am I supposed to do?
May: I think you already know.
Malick: Well, there’s our little space traveler. We were just about to open up the portal. I thought you might want to come and see for yourself.
Simmons: Anyone who goes to that planet will die. That thing on the other side drives people mad.
Malick: Well, that’s certainly an interesting theory. Here’s another. It wants to come back. And finally, after all these years, we finally found someone to help us do that.
Simmons: I’ll never help you bring that thing back, no matter how much you hurt me.
Malick: Which is why we’ve agreed to stop hurting you so that he would go instead.
Simmons: Oh, Fitz.
Fitz: Sorry, Jemma.
Ward: I always thought Fitz would give up the world for you. Looks like now he finally has his chance.
Daisy: Are you sure about this? They haven’t even been cleared for field duty.
Mack: I cleared them just now.
Daisy: Seems I might just get my team after all.
Mack: Listen up! HYDRA has Fitz and Simmons, and they’re planning to open another portal! Which is why we’re going to stop them.
Joey: Yeah, but why us?
Lincoln: I’m guessing we’re all they’ve got.
Mack: You two have powers. My other agents don’t. But I’m not gonna lie to you, this is a dangerous mission, and the odds are not in our favor.
Lincoln: Not really a selling point.
Mack: Here’s the deal. What HYDRA’s planning is gonna hurt a lot of innocent people, maybe people you care about. I wouldn’t be asking you for your help if I didn’t think we had a chance. So either you step up and do the damn job or you let the bad guys win. The choice is yours.
May: Nice speech, director.
Coulson: How long till we reach HYDRA airspace?
Morse: We’re about 10 minutes out. Sir? About what happened back there.
Coulson: We got what we needed. End of story.
Morse: I understand. But that look on your face. I’ve seen it before. It’s the same look Hunter had when he went after Ward.
Coulson: Not sure I’m getting your point.
Morse: It’s dangerous going into a mission that emotional. You need to be able to separate the job from your own feelings.
Coulson: You’re wrong. I’ve been keeping my feelings in check, and look what it got us. Rosalind’s dead, Ward has Fitz and Simmons. My only regret is that I didn’t kill that son of a bitch when I had the chance.
Morse: Coulson…
Coulson: Let me know when we’re close.
Malick: It’s time.
Ward: Start without me. Need to get ready for when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives.
Malick: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s not getting near here.
Ward: Don’t underestimate Coulson.
Malick: Phil Coulson is of no consequence. You, on the other hand, still have an important role to play.
Ward: What are you talking about?
Malick: I want you to lead our men on the other side.
Ward: You can’t be serious. I’ve been working for this moment ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. murdered Kara. Why would I give that up?
Malick: Because you’ve already won. S.H.I.E.L.D.’s finished. Do you really need to take a victory lap?
Ward: This isn’t over till I’m standing over Coulson’s dead body.
Malick: I thought you were more than this, more than bloodthirsty and vindictive. I thought you had vision.
Ward: Vision enough to know when I’m being manipulated into risking my life for someone else’s pipe dream.
Malick: Your dream? Revenge? That’s just vanity, Mr. Ward. That’s a weakness.
Ward: Don’t talk to me about weakness, old man. Weakness is following others blindly. Learned that the hard way.
Malick: I’m not asking you to follow. I’m asking you to lead! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, yes, but I’d hoped that I’d find someone to seize it with me. I thought it might be Pierce, but he was bloodthirsty. Thought it might be John Garrett, but his vanity led him to think of nothing but himself.
Ward: John Garrett is the only reason I put my faith in HYDRA.
Malick: And that is the greatest thing he ever achieved for our cause. I’m no soldier. You’re the finest we ever made. You’re the only one that can do this. And if you cross over to that other side, you will finally see that your faith in HYDRA was never misplaced. It’s real. You will look it in the eye.
Ward: And then?
Malick: And then, we’ll be able to do whatever the hell we want.
Fitz: Hey! You touch her, and the deal’s off.
Simmons: Fitz, you can’t do this.
Fitz: My mind’s made up, Jemma.
Simmons: No, we can’t let them bring that thing back to this planet! Fitz. Please just let them kill me.
Fitz: I can’t do that. I won’t. I lost you once. I can’t lose you again. I’m just… I’m not strong enough to live in a world that doesn’t have you in it.
Simmons: Oh, come back to me. Just don’t bring that thing with you.
Fitz: Only thing I’m gonna bring back is Will. Okay?
Ward: Let’s get this show on the road.
Simmons: What are you doing?
Ward: Leading.
Coulson: Looks like they’re getting ready.
Hunter: They’re gonna take Fitz or Simmons.
Coulson: It’s the smart play. Whatever they want over there, they’ll take one to guide the team back, keep the other one here for insurance. That’s Ward.
Hunter: You can’t seriously know that from a bloody heat signature.
Coulson: It’s him. 
Ward: Wait for me. Once you get down there, you establish a perimeter. Wait for me. I’m right behind you. Get on in.
Malick: Find it, get to the exit coordinates, we’ll turn the portal back on in exactly 12 hours.
Ward: Got it.
Malick: Bring it back, my friend. Be the one that finishes what HYDRA started. Making history today.
Ward: Cheer up. New beginning for both of us.
Morse: He’s going through.
Hunter: If that really is Ward, then we’re too late.
Morse: Can you please go talk some sense into him?
Hunter: You can’t do this. Only a complete lunatic would go down there without a plan.
Coulson: I’m ending this.
Hunter: Oh, bloody hell.
Morse: Wait, wait. What the hell are you doing?
Hunter: We both know common sense was never really my strong suit.
Morse: HYDRA’s got us locked in! We need to move!
Hunter: Coulson, wait!
Malick: Shut it down.
Ward: It’s nothing! Come on. Get moving!
