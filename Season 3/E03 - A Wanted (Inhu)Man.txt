Banks: He’s moving north! Use lethal force if necessary!
Man: Hurry up! Let’s go! Down this trail! Move it! Move it!
Banks: There.
Man: We’ll lose him!
Banks: Stop! Fall back! Unit two can try and head him off. But get her on the phone. Tell her we lost him. It’s time to bring everyone else in on this.
Coulson: Simmons didn’t have to go through quarantine, which is good, all things considered.
Mack: What exactly are these things that we’re considering?
Morse: Everything that comes with being on another planet for months.
Fitz: Different atmosphere, different levels of oxygenation, different microgravity. Every system in her body’s out of whack. Cardiovascular, inner ear, respiratory all got used to being not here.
Morse: Labs indicate oxidative stress, vitamin D deficiency, upper-respiratory irritation.
Coulson: Any mention of life, intelligent or otherwise?
Morse: Some flora, no fauna.
Fitz: She said she was being hunted.
Mack: Wait. What? What does that mean? Hunted by what?
Fitz: She didn’t say. I don’t know if she even knows.
Coulson: My god. Imagine her having to go through all that alone for that long.
Morse: Well, thanks to this guy, not anymore.
Coulson: Monitor her physical health. I’ve got a call in to Dr. Garner. Her mental health is just as important. But don’t push her. She’ll open up when she’s ready.
Daisy: Lincoln’s in trouble. The ATCU issued a nationwide BOLO. FBI, homeland security, local police, all notified. Sent ‘em Lincoln’s résumé and head shot.
Coulson: Sounds like the ATCU’s getting desperate.
Daisy: What are they gonna do when they find him? I’m guessing it won’t be awesome. He needs help.
Mack: Look, we went to Lincoln more than once. He didn’t want our help.
Daisy: It doesn’t mean he deserves to be hunted like a fugitive, not to mention there’s a giant with a grudge looking to kill him.
Coulson: Which is why we need to bring him in, now.
Daisy: That would be the plan if we knew where to find him, but he’s not messaging me back, and I… What?
Mack: You want to tell her?
Daisy: Great. Tell me what? What do neither of you want to tell me?
Coulson: We know how to find him.
Daisy: Lincoln, it’s me.
Lincoln: Daisy? How the hell did you get this number?
Daisy: That’s not important. What’s important right now is that you get somewhere safe.
Lincoln: I just bought this phone.
Daisy: Yes, I know. 35 minutes ago at a liquor store at 71st and Binford.
Lincoln: You know where I am?
Daisy: Yes, and I convinced them to let me talk to you before…
Lincoln: I can’t believe you would do this.
Daisy: Just… Lincoln, just hear me out, okay? The ATCU has released your picture to law enforcement. It’s everywhere, calling for your arrest. We’re gonna come get you. Lincoln?
Mack: You’re not walking out of here till my partner has said her piece.
Coulson: He must have blown his tracker.
Daisy: Yeah, because he’s creeped out that you put a tracker in him.
Mack: Yeah, and if she didn’t give him a heads-up, we could have used it to bring him in.
Daisy: He’s already scared, paranoid. Ambushing him out of nowhere would have made things way worse.
Mack: And he would have been able to express those feelings to us here, secure in our location.
Coulson: All right, all right. Everybody, just relax. We’ll figure this out. 
Hunter: He should be in here. We did a couple of jobs together a while back. He’s tight with HYDRA in the U.K. And continued his association when he relocated here to the U.S. There he is.
May: You lead.
Hunter: Spud.
Spud: Why, here’s Richy! As I live and breathe!
Hunter: Working the bum fluff.
Spud: Ah.
Hunter: Oh, G… Gina, Spud. Spud, Gina.
May: Hey.
Spud: Whoo. Classy for the likes of you, eh?
May: Business associates.
Spud: Mm. Come here. Oh! First round’s on me.
Hunter: Oh, nice one.
Spud: Hey!
May: Uh, so, Richy tells us you’re the guy to go to if we need to unload…
Spud: Hold your horses.
Hunter: That’s not how it’s done. First we drink, then we talk business.
Spud: Oi! Three pints.
May: Right, ‘cause you guys aren’t hard enough to understand as it is.
Hunter: It was abysmal. We’d been in the van for donkeys me and this joker. Fifty keys of black market cogmium steel in the back. Then on the radio…
Spud: Wind your neck in.
Hunter: … that song “Love Bites” comes on. You know that song? Yeah, so that comes on, and this one, this geezer’s blubbing, all snot…
Spud: Sod off. My fiancé had just scarpered. Left me in the dust. I was gutted.
Hunter: At ten hours, every time it comes on, he’s a quivering shambles.
Spud: You played it on a loop, you muppet.
Hunter: Yeah, you’re right. I did, didn’t I?Man, classic road trip.
May: All right. He’s a muppet. But if we don’t start talking shop soon, he’s gonna pass out, so…
Spud: Have something to unload?
May: Weapons. Next gen, high potential damage.
Hunter: We need buyers with deep pockets and bad intentions.
May: A finder’s fee for you, of course.
Spud: I know people. But they have massive trust issues.
Hunter: What do they want? A letter of recommendation?
Spud: Me vouching won’t be enough.
Hunter: Well, what is? Do I buy my way in?
Spud: No. You fight your way in. If you are the last man standing, you’ll get a meeting.
Hunter: Sounds like a laugh.
Reporter: The suspect is considered dangerous. And is wanted by both federal authorities and the ATCU.
Coulson: This went from bad to really really bad.
Mack: They’ve gone public.
Reporter: If you do see this man, do not engage.
Reporter 1: Well, it looks like another wet one, folks. Possible thunderstorms over the next few hours.
Reporter 2: In other news, a suspect has been identified in the Cincinnati hospital alien terrorist attack that left three dead, many more injured. If you have any information about the man pictured here, be sure to contact the authorities.
Man: Hey! You’re him.
Lincoln: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Man: I saw you. I know what you are.
Lincoln: You have no idea.
Coulson: Daisy, I need you to monitor all law enforcement near Lincoln’s last known location.
Daisy: How about we take a team, go look for ourselves?
Mack: No, the ATCU’s on a witch hunt for powered people.
Daisy: I’m not afraid of them.
Coulson: No, but they’re terrified of you, which makes them dangerous. Till we know where he is, you’re not going out there.
Daisy: Permission to speak freely.
Coulson: Do I have a choice?
Daisy: I could have talked him in if you didn’t put an unsolicited tracker under his skin.
Mack: If you didn’t call to alert him, then we…
Daisy: Why wasn’t I told?
Coulson: We thought you were a little close to the situation.
Daisy: Of course I’m close to the situation. You asked me to assemble a team, and I accepted. I didn’t expect to be undermined and…
Coulson: Do you know what I didn’t expect? A global outbreak. The ATCU, their inhuman manhunt. I didn’t see all that coming, to be honest. I wanted to assemble a team, to get ahead of the problem, but that didn’t happen. So, Daisy.
Daisy: I’ll scan law-enforcement channels.
Coulson: Thank you. Mack, you were able to identify Rosalind Price’s photo.
Mack: Mm-hmm.
Coulson: How about getting me her digits?
Mack: You got it.
Simmons: Still acclimating to less gravity.
Morse: Now this is a sight for sore eyes.
Fitz: Thought it would be good to get back in the lab, see the old workspace.
Simmons: Is that it?
Morse: It was the portal. Now it’s a pile of space rocks.
Fitz: I’ve run a complete and exhaustive set of diagnostics, so I can assure you there’s no need to worry.
Fitz: You okay?
Simmons: Fine.
Morse: Just a sec. It’s Hunter. He’s on a Ward hunt.
Simmons: Say “hi.”
Morse: You know it.
Fitz: Hey, look. Just as you left it. Made sure not even a post-it note was moved, 'cause I know how particular you can be about it.
Fitz: What is it?
Simmons: Um, I’m just… I’m not accustomed to this many distractions.
Fitz: Yeah, well, I imagine you must have had quite a lot to take in, extraterrestrial materials and specimens to examine.
Simmons: My curiosity faded once fear set in.
Fitz: Right. Yeah, no, of course. Sorry.
Simmons: Uh, I have to admit it’s all a bit much. Would you mind?
Fitz: Uh, yeah. Well, should I get Bobbi?
Simmons: No. Um, it’s just a little disorientation, attributable to oxidative stress.
Fitz: Okay, yeah, I’ll take you back to your room.
Simmons: I hope you’re not too disappointed.
Fitz: No, on the contrary, you’re self-diagnosing, which is a sign you’re on the mend.
Hunter: And how is she now?
Morse: As weirded out as you’d be after being stranded for months in another solar system.
Hunter: Oh, I must say, H.Q. sounds a lot more fun than what we’re up to.
Morse: Why don’t I believe you? And why do you sound hung over?
Hunter: Because I am hung over. There’s nothing to do here but drink. Planes, trains, and automobiles, chasing down leads, still no sign of Ward.
Morse: So, you’re not doing anything stupid?
Hunter: Mm, not yet. But one of those trains is about to leave the station, and I need to get on it.
Morse: Well, good luck. Don’t die.
Hunter: Only thing I’ll die of is boredom.
May: You lied to her.
Hunter: Barely. Besides, she knows I’m lying, so it’s not even really a lie. Works for us, for now. You know how complicated these things can be, affairs of the heart, especially in our line of work. Me and Bob. You and Andrew.
May: So, you trust Spud?
Hunter: Trust’s a strong word for a psychopath. He’s a murderous thief who I once saw bite a man’s nose clean off. But he’ll get us through the door. You’ll find this funny. Back at H.Q., we’ve got a little wager going on what happened between you and the good doctor. My guess is you walked away not in a huff or anything, just couldn’t stand the constant talking, sharing.
May: It’s true. I don’t like a lot of talking. This fight, it’s our way to Ward, so if you’re gonna do this, you need to win.
Hunter: Are you suggesting I can’t win?
May: I’m not saying you can’t, but I know I can.
Hunter: Spud runs with a type. If that type see a small Asian woman destroy some wannabe Hydra thug in a bare-knuckle brawl, that type will talk, and word might spread up the ranks.
May: I see your point.
Hunter: You’re just anxious to bash some heads after being out of the game. Look. I’ve rarely lost a fight when I’m sober, which I plan on being. And I can take a punch, so worst case, I’ll do that till the other guy tires out.
May: So, how much do you have riding on this bet that I left Andrew?
Hunter: A significant sum.
May: Well, you lost it.
John: Hey.
Lincoln: Hey.
John: Have you been drinking?
Lincoln: I wanted to. Instead, I called you. You’re the only one I trust.
John: Get in. It’s a hell of a long way for a ride.
Lincoln: I know. I’ll take care of the tolls on the way back.
John: Ah.
John: You slept the whole drive.
Lincoln: I was pretty wiped out.
John: Yeah, I was kind of hoping for the hilarious tale of why. You didn’t call to have me talk you off a ledge. Not this time, anyway. Lincoln, what’s going on?
Lincoln: Uh, I’m in a little bit of trouble.
John: You are killing me with these details.
Lincoln: You don’t want to know. Look, it’s a misunderstanding. I promise you, I haven’t done anything wrong.
John: Okay, that is all I need to hear. I know what kind of man you are. Just tell me what you need.
Lincoln: I was hoping, uh… You’d let me buy your car off of you. I know it’s a lot to ask. Uh, I’ll pay cash.
John: Done.
Lincoln: John, I don’t know what to say.
John: All right, now, wait a minute. You’re… you’re doing me a favor. It’s a pile of rust. All right? I’ll make us some dinner. I don’t know. Take a nap, or the shower’s over there, if you want to take a shower. Mi casa, su casa. It’s gonna be okay.
Price: He didn’t just disappear. Unless he did. Well, he can’t do that, can he?
Banks: No. Electric’s his thing. He’ll show. That’s why we alerted the public. He’s got nowhere to hide.
Price: I hope so. We need to start making progress, showing results.
Woman: Ms. price, you have a call.
Price: Well, it can wait.
Woman: It’s the White House.
Price: Uh, throw it up on my screen. Coulson?
Coulson: Call me Phil.
Price: What I can’t call you is POTUS.
Coulson: You’re not the only person with a connection to the White House. Well, mine’s a pirated satellite connection that will be discovered soon, so I’ll be brief. You’re making a lot of noise, and frankly, I’m a little insulted. You’re asking everyone for help, the FBI, local police, and now the public, everyone except the people who actually know something.
Price: You mean you.
Coulson: That is what I mean, yes. So, I think we should meet, just the two of us, in person, neutral ground.
Price: Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
Banks: We have a location on Lincoln Campbell. He’s holed up in an apartment outside Chicago.
Price: You know what you need to do. Okay, Phil, let’s meet. I think we’ll have a lot to talk about.
Daisy: I cannot believe you’re here.
Simmons: Skye. Daisy. Sorry.
Daisy: It’s a multipurpose gift. It’s pretty and a reminder. You can call me whatever you want. I can’t stay for too long. I’m tracking law-enforcement channels, but I am really sorry that I haven’t come sooner. It’s… there’s just a lot going on.
Simmons: And I’ve been sleeping.
Daisy: Which is good. Do whatever you need to get better. We need you. And I… I know you don’t want to talk about what happened yet, but when you do, I’m here, for whatever you need.
Simmons: Right now I’d rather listen. The Terrigen is spreading?
Daisy: So’s the paranoia.
John: Not exactly the penthouse view. You looking for something?
Lincoln: No, I just… it’s hard to relax, you know?
John: I know.
Lincoln: Everything okay?
John: Why wouldn’t it be?
Lincoln: Maybe I will hop in the shower. John, what’s up? What’s wrong?
John: You just stay where you are. Don’t touch me.
Lincoln: Wait. What is going on?
John: They’ll be here any minute.
Lincoln: Who did you call?
John: I called the hotline. They said that you’re dangerous. Lincoln, they said that you killed people.
Lincoln: I never killed anyone, I swear. You said you know what type of man I am.
John: I don’t even know what you are. They say you’re an alien.
Lincoln: It’s not at all what you think.
John: You just stay there. Stay there! I’m not kidding! Stay there. They’re gonna be here any minute.
Lincoln: Here. I’m gonna leave the money and take the car. You don’t need to be involved.
John: Just stay back!
Lincoln: Get out of my way! Sorry I brought you into this.
John: No.
Lincoln: No, no, no, no. No, John. Come on, John!
Daisy: You’re really okay?
Simmons: I think so. I’m… Well, it’s just that… There’s some of it that’s hard to talk about, and, um…
Daisy: I am so sorry.
Simmons: No. Take it.
Lincoln: Daisy.
Daisy: Lincoln, I am so sorry. I… I had no idea about the tracker, and if I did, I…
Lincoln: Don’t worry about that now.
Daisy: What’s wrong?
Lincoln: I need help.
Man: He’s not here.
Daisy: Lincoln’s hiding. He’s waiting for us.
Coulson: We need to bring him in, preferably without the ATCU knowing.
Mack: Even though he just killed a guy.
Daisy: I told you it was an accident.
Coulson: We’ll figure it out once we get him in here. It’d be safer if Mack handled the extraction.
Daisy: I know, but then he won’t come. It’s got to be me.
Coulson: Your call.
Mack: And where are you going?
Coulson: To the beach.
Morse:: I’d give anything to be in the field.
Fitz: Rehab is the antithesis of exciting, I’m well-aware, but it’s worth it. You notice I was able to say “antithesis.”
Morse: You check on Simmons?
Fitz: Yeah. She’s kind of… Distant. I’m not sure that I know how to help her.
Morse: What did you drill into my head when I started rehabbing my knee?
Fitz: Patience.
Morse: Exactly.
Fitz: Yeah, I know. I know. It’s just the lab… she loved that lab, designed it according to her specifications. Now it’s…
Morse: Could be it reminds her of the way things were and all the time she lost.
Fitz: Yeah. I didn’t think of that.
Morse: Maybe forget about the things that used to matter to her. Give her something to look forward to. Start fresh.
Fitz: Yeah. Yeah, maybe you’re right. Thanks.
Price: Got to say, I was pretty surprised when I got your call. Eyes up here.
Coulson: Busted. Sorry. I appreciate you taking the time.
Price: Gave me an excuse to drive up the coast.
Coulson: Does she have a name?
Price: I love my car, but it’s just a car. And it’s a him. You know, last time we met, you, uh, disarmed me with your evasive tactics.
Coulson: I see what you did there.
Price: No, I got to hand it to you. Makes me wonder what else you got up your sleeve.
Coulson: No, really, I get it.
Price: Hard to resist. I assume I’m not the first.
Coulson: I think you are. It’s fairly recent.
Price: Sorry. That can’t be easy.
Coulson: That’s not what we came here to discuss. You’re going about this all wrong. Panicking the public, not wise. Keep doing that, things are gonna get ugly real fast.
Man: Yeah, man! Come on!
Man: Let’s go! You got it.
Man: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Back off!
Tat: The winner! Yeah! The winner! That’s right!
Man: All right, he’s done. Get him out of here. Next man up. Let’s go. Come on.
Man: Get him out of here.
Hunter: Is he breathing?
May: There.
Hunter: Are you good?
May: I’m not the one who needs to be good.
Spud: Richy’s here. We can get started.
Hunter: Who’s the unlucky sod, then? What the hell are you doing?
Spud: Shutting your stupid face up once and for all.
Man: In position.
Hunter: Are you having a laugh? I thought we were mates.
Spud: You thought wrong, you mug.
Man: All right.
Hunter: Oh, are there any rules I should know about before we start?
Man: Nope.
Hunter: I thought we was having a laugh.
Spud: I wasn’t laughing.
Hunter: Not even on the inside?
Man: Hey. Let me get you a drink.
May: I’m not thirsty.
Man: Let’s try that again. A drink?
May: And again, no.
Man: Come on. I promise you’ll have a good time.
May: So, who’s first?
Man: Oh!
May: Aah!
May: How about I do you a favor and not tell anyone that a tiny, little Asian woman kicked your ass?
Hunter: Are you not tired yet? 'Cause that was sort of my strategy.
Spud: Come on! Aaah!
Man: Yeah! One more!
Hunter: Somebody gonna call it?
Man: What’s the point? He’s not breathing.
Price: You know, my agency exists because yours imploded.
Coulson: But we came back, albeit with less real estate and a lower profile.
Price: The low profile’s the problem. No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening. And people need to feel safe.
Coulson: So all these APBs on alien threats, those are to help people feel safe? Look, the truth is, you don’t understand what you’re dealing with.
Price: And you do?
Coulson: Which is why I’m asking you to let my team bring Lincoln in. If we take him, it’ll be easy. If you do it, people could get hurt.
Price: That might be the case, but I’m sorry. I can’t agree to that.
Mack: Coast is clear.
Daisy: It’s me. You’re having a hell of a day.
Lincoln: I, um… I killed him. John, um, he saved my life more than once. And now, I couldn’t bring him back. Everything they’re saying about me is true.
Price: He’s extremely dangerous.
Coulson: He won’t be if he’s in our custody.
Price: We’re not gonna harvest him for parts, if that’s what you’re worried about. We’re not HYDRA.
Coulson: You say that now. What’s so important about him?
Price: Are you serious? He can bring down a plane. Feels like a man worth talking to.
Coulson: I have another theory. The president makes a big speech about this new organization he’s put in place. I imagine that puts a lot of pressure on you, pressure to show results.
Price: You’re not wrong. And that’s why I’m taking him in. But why are we here, Phil? Are we waiting to watch the sunset together? 'Cause if you didn’t come here to make a deal, then what do you want?
Coulson: You have an ace up your sleeve, and I’m tired of waiting for you to play it.
Price: Is that so?
Coulson: You have surveillance from the hospital, which means there’s another picture you chose not to put on TV.
Price: A pretty face. There’s no name, no birth record, no social attached to it. She’s one of them. And she works for you, right?
Coulson: What do I need to do to keep this quiet?
Price: You know what I want.
Daisy: Fine, they’re right, you’re dangerous. I’m dangerous. But that’s not who you are. You…
Lincoln: You’re wrong.
Daisy: I know the real you, Lincoln, and you…
Lincoln: You don’t. The man who killed his only friend, who had to be saved from himself over and over? That’s the real me. That’s who I really am.
Daisy: Not when I met you. You gave me hope, a place in the world.
Lincoln: Look what happened to it. You know better than anyone, if everything around you crumbles, then you’re the cause.
Daisy: Stop! You don’t see it, but I do. You… you help people because you were meant to. You can do that with us, like you were doing at the hospital saving lives.
Lincoln: That part of my life is over.
Daisy: No, you… you are not cursed. You are not some horrible thing. I know, because you taught me that I wasn’t. You convinced me that I had a purpose, that maybe my life wasn’t over, but just… getting somewhere. Please let me do the same for you.
Lincoln: You’re wasting your time caring about me.
Daisy: I can’t help it.
Lincoln: I’ll go in with you. I’m not agreeing to work with S.H.I.E.L.D., but with you.
Daisy: We’ll figure it out together. Great. Is the, um, escape module on its way?
Mack: Change of plans. Coulson’s orders. We’re turning him over to the ATCU.
Daisy: Get Coulson on the phone.
Mack: He said he’d explain back at headquarters.
Lincoln: Daisy, what’s happening?
Mack: Coulson told me to let you know that you’re gonna be safe. He’s arranged for us to observe and make sure…
Banks: Can we get on with this?
Daisy: This is crazy!
Mack: He said he didn’t have a choice.
Banks: Take him into custody.
Man 1: Suspect’s on the move. Seal off the street.
Man 2: Awaiting orders.
Man 1: Should we go after him?
Banks: No. Bird in the hand. We take her.
Mack: What the hell do you think you’re doing?
Banks: Following orders.
Daisy: Do you really think you can stop me? Do you have any idea what I can do?
Banks: Yeah. That’s why I have three snipers outside, ready to engage. What’s the range on these powers of yours? How good are they?
Mack: Actually, pretty damn good.
Coulson: Tell your men to stand down.
Price: I can’t do that. He got away, and I’ve made assurances.
Coulson: I assure you that if you insist on taking my agent in, you will start a war. I will devote all the resources and manpower of S.H.I.E.L.D. to crushing your agency.
Price: It’s not personal. It’s work. And right now I need to show results.
Coulson: What if I offer something better?
Banks: Copy that. I guess it’s your lucky day. We’re done. Let’s go.
Fitz: I thought it’d be good for you to get out somewhere nice, and quiet.
Simmons: Where is everyone?
Fitz: Well, I made sure you wouldn’t have any distractions.
Waiter: Mr. Fitz, we’re delighted to see you. Your table is this way. The wine is a gift from us. A very persistent young man here. We’ve been holding this reservation for months. I’m delighted you’re finally here.
Simmons: You kept the reservation.
Fitz: Don’t make a fuss. It’s not a big deal. I remember when you took me out after months in the hospital. It made me feel like a human being again.
Simmons: You complained the entire time.
Fitz: Well… Okay, a crabby human being.
Simmons: I can’t thank you enough.
Fitz: Yeah. It’s a nice restaurant, isn’t it?
Simmons: Yeah, but for more than that. For finding me.
Fitz: What else was I gonna do?
Simmons: I don’t know what to say.
Fitz: You don’t have to say anything.
Waiter: Have you decided what you’ll be having?
Simmons: Oh, gosh. So much.
Fitz: Maybe this will help. Should I make a toast? What? Can you give us two minutes?
Waiter: Of course.
Simmons: I’m sorry.
Daisy: Help me understand.
Coulson: It was not an easy decision.
Daisy: To hand Lincoln over.
Coulson: I had to make a choice.
Daisy: So it was him or me.
Coulson: They have your picture, Daisy.
Daisy: So why didn’t they take me? Once Lincoln left, how did you convince them not to take me in?
Coulson: I offered them something just as valuable.
Daisy: What?
Coulson: Me. My expertise.
Daisy: So… so now we’re working with them?
Coulson: I’m done fighting with people over who gets to fight the real fight. It’s a colossal waste of time and resources. I went against Talbot. I went against another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. We know what we’re doing, they don’t. Hopefully, they can learn from us.
Daisy: It is hard to trust them when they are hunting people like me.
Coulson: I never said I trust them.
Daisy: Good. Don’t, because we have no idea what they’re really after.
Coulson: Duly noted. Look, I understand this is a personal matter for you.
Daisy: So Mack told you what he heard me say?
Coulson: And what would that be? It’s Rosalind.
Daisy: First name basis, huh? I’ll leave you to it.
Coulson: Well, I’m surprised to hear from you so soon.
Price: Just checking, making sure you didn’t give me a fake number.
Mack: You all right?
Daisy: I’ve been better. Thanks for not saying anything.
Mack: You know, I sure could use some backup. Let’s see what kind of skills you got, kid.
Daisy: All right.
Hunter: You certainly don’t make it easy to get a meeting.
Kebo: The boss doesn’t want it to be easy. But he’s always interested in meeting people who can prove themselves.
Hunter: Sounds like an interesting bloke. I look forward to meeting him someday.
Morse: Simmons? Why are you looking at that?
Simmons: Trying to understand.
Morse: There’s nothing to learn from this.
Simmons: It’s possible it’s not inert. Alien metals have different properties. We don’t know for sure.
Morse: Yes, we do. You’re safe. That portal won’t open again.
Simmons: But it has to. I have to go back.
