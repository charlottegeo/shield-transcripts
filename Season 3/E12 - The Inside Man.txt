Hive: Grant Ward. I wish we could have met under different circumstances.
Malick: He was a good soldier. He dedicated his life to HYDRA.
Hive: Thank you for arranging that. He was strong, resilient, a perfect host.
Malick: I made some moves this week to ensure we have all the inhumans we need when the time comes. In fact, I just acquired one you might find useful. Bring him in.
Lucio (in Spanish): You’re a bunch of filthy pigs and I’m going to kill you all.
Malick: See if you can get through to him.
Hive: I want to see his eyes.
Lucio: What are you?
Hive: What are we?
Talbot: Don’t leave like this, Carla. It’s not my fault. I just couldn’t say no to the President.
Carla: Yes, you could have. You just didn’t want to. You’re always choosing career over family, Glenn.
Talbot: That’s not true.
Carla: And now we’re finally paying the price.
Talbot: I’m gonna fix this, Carla.
Coulson: Everything okay?
Talbot: What the hell are you doing here? Are you spying on me? You know, my personal life is none of your damn business.
Coulson: You’re right. But the ATCU is, which you now run. And since you refuse to talk to me or return my calls, I didn’t really have a choice.
Talbot: I’ve been busy.
Coulson: You know I’m technically your boss now, right? But I’d prefer to be partners.
Talbot: You are not now, nor will you ever be, my boss. And we will never be partners. I didn’t ask to get put in front of this sideshow circus. If I find out you had anything to do with it…
Coulson: It was the president’s idea, as was the symposium in Taiwan that we’re supposed to be getting ready for. We need to be prepared.
Talbot: Somehow, I have a feeling your idea of being prepared and my idea of being prepared are two wildly different things.
Fitz: Watch where you’re aiming that! You’re not seriously gonna take that with you, are you?
Hunter: Best to be overprepared than caught with your guns down.
Fitz: It’s a diplomatic conference.
Hunter: Yeah. Throw inhumans into the mix, and you have to expect the unexpected. Speedy powers, melty powers, eyeball death rays.
Fitz: Well, that’s why we’ve got Daisy and Lincoln with us.
Hunter: Oh, yeah. Good old shake'n bake. What’s in the case?
Fitz: It’s the director’s new toy, something we’ve been working on.
Hunter: Does it kill, stun, or disintegrate?
Fitz: It makes gloves.
Morse: Hey, Fitz.
Daisy: Are you coming with us?
Fitz: My work’s done. I’m just gonna put this in the Director’s Cabin.
Morse: So, what do you know about this conference?
Daisy: I know it’s small, secret, just a few countries. They’re calling it “a symposium on the alien contagion.” No wonder everyone is afraid of us when they use words like that. And you know, we’re only part alien, and it’s not a disease, it’s an awakening.
Morse: Interesting word choice.
Daisy: I mean, for me. Terrigenesis made me who I was supposed to be. I was given a gift, and I use it to stop bad people from doing bad things.
Morse: Unfortunately, some of those bad people were also inhumans.
Daisy: Yeah, well, you know who else does bad things are humans, but you don’t see any symposiums on the human contagion.
Morse: Humans, we know. Inhumans are brand-new territory. People fear what they don’t understand. Any word from Lincoln? How’s his field op with May going?
Daisy: Just a trial run. But having been there myself, I’d say… he’s miserable.
May: You’re too obvious. Blend in.
Lincoln: I’ve been blending in half my life. Pretty sure I can handle this. Where are you?
May: Watching your every move. Stay focused. Field work isn’t always about rushing in and using your powers. Look for anything out of the ordinary, people with their hands in their pockets, long coats, clothes that don’t match the weather.
Lincoln: Wait. I think I see something suspicious.
May: What is it? What do you see?
Lincoln: No one would ever intentionally cut their hair like that.
May: Not funny. We’re here to protect the Director. Try and remember that.
Talbot: This symposium is gonna be a colossal waste of time. Sitting around a conference table, singing “Kumbaya” is not going to accomplish a damn thing.
Coulson: I’m less interested in the symposium than I am with the intel we can gather there. We need to know if any of these countries are harboring inhumans.
Talbot: So it’s a sneaky, little spy mission.
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D., remember? That’s how we roll.
Lincoln: May, I’ve got one. No joke.
Coulson: My gut tells me Malick will have a presence there. Someone in his pocket trying to influence the delegates while getting information on any inhumans.
Talbot: Sounds like you.
Coulson: Yeah. But we’re the good guys. I know it’s none of my business, but I hope you and Carla work things out for your son. George, right? What is he, 11 now?
Talbot: He’s 12.
Coulson: A good age.
Talbot: Yeah.
Coulson: Good night, General.
Talbot: Director.
May: Coulson, 12 o'clock. Get out of there now!
Coulson: Creel. Get in.
Talbot: Hey! Coulson!
Coulson: May, they got Carl Creel. I need backup.
May: Lincoln, forget what I said. Rush in and use your powers.
Lincoln: I’m on it.
Lincoln: Hey, michelin man. Let’s finish this.
May: Lincoln!
May: Lincoln, enough!
Coulson: Stand down. That’s an order!
Talbot: What the hell do you think you’re doing?!
Coulson: It’s Creel. He was trying to assassinate you.
Talbot: Assassinate me? He’s here to protect me.
Fitz: His absorbing powers don’t seem so impressive now, not with all the inhumans around.
Simmons: Mr. Creel, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. Do you know how you got your powers?
Creel: An experiment.
Simmons: Something went wrong.
Creel: Something went right.
Simmons: You’re the only human who survived contact with a terrigen obelisk. What was that like?
Creel: It hurt.
Simmons: Well, by all accounts, you should be dead. Only inhumans can touch them and survive. Do you know how that was possible?
Creel: Beats me.
Fitz: I still have a sample of his DNA.
Simmons: Yeah, perhaps we should reopen our study, now we know more about the inhumans. Do you know how long we’ll be keeping him here?
Fitz: I don’t know. There’s still a lot of bad blood.
Hunter: He killed my friends, Izzy and Idaho. I watched them die.
Talbot: He was brainwashed by HYDRA. He didn’t know what he was doing. It took us months to undo their dirty work. He’s a good kid.
Morse: He’s a murderer.
May: And he had a criminal record long before HYDRA got their hands on him.
Talbot: He’s from the streets. He made some mistakes. He’s reformed.
Coulson: I believe everyone deserves a second chance, but taking him with us on a covert mission doesn’t seem like the place to test it.
Talbot: It’s a crazy world out there, full of powered people. I finally have one of my own. I don’t leave home without him.
Coulson: What are you saying?
Talbot: He doesn’t go, I don’t go.
Daisy: Fine. We’ll go without you. We don’t need him.
Coulson: Actually, we do. If the acting head of our own ATCU doesn’t show up, it sends a bad message. Not to mention it will embarrass the president and destroy any hope of an international coalition.
Hunter: What are you saying?
Coulson: He goes.
Hunter: You can’t be serious.
Coulson: This debate is over. I’m taking a big leap of faith. You better be right.
Talbot: I trust him with my life.
Daisy: If he steps out of line in any way, Lincoln and I will take him down so hard, he’ll never get up.
Coulson: Agent May, will you escort General Talbot down to see Creel?
Talbot: Excuse me.
Daisy: I’m not kidding. I will hurt him.
Coulson: You’re not on this op.
Daisy: What do you mean? I should be there.
Coulson: I agree, but there are two rules for the symposium. The first is, no aliens. The delegates want to be able to speak freely without fear of offending anyone.
Daisy: Yeah, well, it’s too late for that.
Morse: And what’s the second rule?
Coulson: No weapons.
Hunter: And what are we supposed to do if someone else decides not to play by those rules?
Coulson: That’s why having Creel there might not be such a bad idea. He’s not inhuman, so he’ll pass any DNA screenings they may have, and if he is truly reformed, could be an asset.
Hunter: You can’t take the bad out of a bad man.
Malick: May I have a word? Your body isn’t improving. Maybe a new host, one not so damaged.
Hive: I know you’re not offering yourself. The host must be dead.
Malick: Oh, no. I’m afraid this old body wouldn’t be the right choice. Perhaps Giyera, an inhuman.
Hive: I cannot inhabit inhumans. We cannot feed on our own kind.
Malick: Well, I’m sure I could find a volunteer.
Hive: Grant Ward will serve my needs until we’re ready.
Malick: Very well, then. Uh… I can assure you there won’t be any more setbacks.
Hive: Good. We like to hear that.
May: Briefing’s about to start. Hunter.
Hunter: I’m tempted to throw him off the plane right now. We made a deal with the devil once before, and we all know how that worked out.
May: Mission’s more important.
Hunter: Aren’t you tired of saying that? ‘Cause I’m tired of hearing it. Certainly didn’t apply when your husband’s life was on the line. Stating the obvious. I’m just here to make sure my friends don’t die. He has a habit of killing them.
May: You’re here for Bobbi. Nothing more. She’s the only reason why you call yourself an Agent and why you couldn’t care less about the mission.
Hunter: Are you saying you’d rather have that guy covering you than me?
May: Honestly, not so sure.
Hunter: Well, that’s no way to treat a friend who’s just trying to watch your back.
May: We’re not friends.
Hunter: I’ll carry on watching your back, regardless.
Coulson: There will be five other delegates at the symposium with General Talbot. They have information that we need and that Malick would like to get his hands on. Malick’s obsession with inhumans continues, so it’s likely that one of these delegates is his inside man.
Morse: Or woman.
Coulson: Our mission, collect intel on any foreign inhumans and uncover the insider so that we can track them back to Malick. The symposium kicks off with a reception held by our Taiwanese hosts. All of the delegates will be in attendance, along with their attachés, a small number of invited guests, General Talbot, and myself.
Talbot: I don’t care what they call it. It’s a dress. You must be loving this.
Coulson: You’re the president’s official representative. It’s a customary way to honor them for hosting this symposium, and you look very dignified.
Talbot: It’s all loosey-goosey under there.
Coulson: I will be attending as Dr. Sean Lundwall, a CDC expert in alien biology. General Talbot, as acting head of the ATCU, will attend as himself.
Petrov: General Talbot? I recognize your face. Anton Petrov. Please thank your president for organizing this. I think we will all find it very valuable.
Talbot: This is Dr. Lundwall from the CDC.
Petrov: Oh, uh, so sorry. Uh, I very much look forward to your presentation. We have so much to learn about these creatures. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Talbot: That’s our guy.
Coulson: Because he called them “creatures?” Could be a mistranslation.
Talbot: Because he’s Russian, and he’s probably in cahoots with that sushiyaki.
Coulson: Yakimura?
Talbot: Yeah.
Coulson: Talbot and I will find out what we can at the reception. The rest is up to you once the symposium starts. I’ve acquired a list of the delegates rooms. Those rooms are only accessible with a full palm print.
Hunter: So, how are we supposed to get in? Do you want us to cut their hands off?
Coulson: We won’t need to cut off any hands, but I will need to shake a few.
Coulson: Ms. Chen. Dr. Sean Lundwall. It’s a beautiful place. Thank you for hosting.
Chen: It’s our pleasure.
Hunter: Fits like a glove.
Chen: General Talbot. I must say, I’m quite honored that you’re wearing a traditional long gown.
Talbot: Well, the honor’s all mine. I don’t put on a dress for just anyone.
Coulson: I don’t think we’ve met.
King: Ellen King. Have you found a cure for them, Doctor?
Coulson: A cure needs a disease.
King: Interesting. I’m sure you’ll enlighten us all later. Excuse us.
Talbot: I think it’s Chen. She’s too nice. Never trust nice. Although, did you see the scar on down under’s face? Maybe she tangled with one of the inhumans, got her all hotheaded, you know?
Coulson: Congratulations. You’ve just narrowed it down to everyone.
Malick: Don’t leave his side until I return. I’m concerned about the way he looks. You call me if anything changes.
Giyera: Yes, sir. Hail Hydra.
Hive: Despite what he just said, I’m gonna need you both to leave my side.
Giyera: What do you need?
Hive: Humans, five of them. Alive.
Lincoln: I’m not gonna fight you.
Daisy: It’s not fighting. It’s training.
Lincoln: We finally found a night off together, and this is what you want to do? We could be lounging or binge-watching some show or…
Daisy: I need to blow off some steam, and you need to get ready for your agent assessment at the cocoon.
Lincoln: Yeah, can’t wait. More time apart.
Daisy: I like it when you miss me. No powers. Okay? Just you and me.
Daisy: You’re getting better. Is this how you’ve been spending your free time?
Lincoln: What free time?
Daisy: I think you’re starting to like spending time in the field… that rush of adrenaline.
Lincoln: Not so sure the field is my thing.
Daisy: What’s your thing?
Lincoln: Don’t know. Maybe it’s you.
Simmons: Oh. So sorry. Um, there’s something going on with Creel’s DNA sample. I could really use a doctor who understands inhuman biology.
Daisy: Well, I happen to have one of those right here. Go do your thing.
Lincoln: We’re gonna pick this up right where we left off.
Talbot: Have a seat, please. I trust you’ve all had a chance to recover, freshen up from that reception. I got to say, it’s nice to finally put a series of faces to all your unpronounceable names. Uh, okay, well, on behalf of President Ellis, I’d like to thank you all for gathering here. As I’m sure you’re all aware, there have been rumors, reports, and sightings of a new breed of alien living among us. Now, it’s our hope that, by working together, we can come to a consensus about how to deal with them.
Coulson: We can start by not calling them aliens. They prefer the term “inhumans.”
King: What kind of a name is that? Is it meant to intimidate us, mock us?
Coulson: Not at all. They’re just trying to find their place in the world, but they’re more human than anything else, and I think it’s important that we see them that way.
May: King sounds a little hostile. I’m in. Haruto Yakimura’s room.
Coulson: It’s not a virus or a disease. It can’t be spread. It’s a genetic anomaly that affects a very, very small percentage of the population, but they’re as human as we are, just… with a little something extra.
Yakimura: Unfortunately, this something extra could destroy us all.
Coulson: That depends on whether we make them our friends or our enemies. We should think of them as an opportunity, an opportunity for compassion.
Petrov: I agree. Uh, these inhumans are not our enemies. In fact, should their numbers increase, my country is prepared to establish a home for them within our borders, a sanctuary state, where they could live in peace if they so choose. Build a community, teach us about themselves.
Morse: All the inhumans in one spot? That’s one-stop shopping for Malick. I’m putting my money on this guy Petrov.
Yakimura: Whether they are human or alien is not the issue. Their powers are the issue. And let’s face it, each of our nations would rather have that power on our side. This is an arms race, and sending any inhumans we may find off to Russia is like sending them our nuclear weapons.
Zuma: They are not weapons.
King: Weapons or not, I think this is a very naive and dangerous proposition. To put them all in one place? They could organize, rise up against us.
Yakimura: There are hardly enough of them to be.
King: Not yet. But who knows how many more are coming?
Morse: Are you listening to this, Hunter?
Hunter: I’m listening.
Morse: The Australian sounds paranoid.
Hunter: I’m in her room now. Whatever she’s hiding, I’ll find it. Oh, bloody hell. I knew it. Creel’s leaving his post. Making a run for it.
Simmons: Here we have a sample of Daisy’s blood taken two years ago, before she was exposed to terrigen. When we add the terrigen. The reaction is what we’d expect.
Lincoln: Terrigenesis.
Simmons: Dr. Fitz, if you wouldn’t mind. Here, we have the same blood, but watch what happens when we add a sample of Creel’s blood to the mix. It not only stops the terrigenesis process. It breaks it down.
Fitz: Creel’s blood is protecting hers.
Lincoln: A vaccine against terrigenesis.
Simmons: Potentially. It can’t reverse the effects once someone’s transformed, but…
Lincoln: This could virtually put an end to…
Daisy: To us? I’m sorry, but isn’t that what you were gonna say?
Zuma: We do not believe the inhumans are a plague or weapons. I support Mr. Petrov’s sanctuary state, and I propose we vote on the matter.
Chen: I second that.
Talbot: If the Russki turns out to be the inside man, this vote could be a bad thing for us. We’ve got three yeas, two nays. If I vote yea, he’s gonna have a lot of inhumans in his backyard when the sun comes up, you know?
May: We’ve caught an encrypted text going out. Looks like it’s from Ellen King. Hunter, are you in her room?
Morse: Hunter’s off mission. He’s chasing Creel. Can you decrypt the message?
May: Decrypting. “Move… Him… Now.” We need to get in her room.
Morse: Copy that.
Hunter: That truck looks like a good place to hide. Easy way out. Ohh, guns. Why does no one ever listen to me?
Morse: May, I’ve got something. She’s got an inhuman locked up and sedated for military experiments, but I’m not seeing a Malick connection.
May: Any word from Hunter?
Morse: Radio silence.
Hunter: Bobbi and May, we’ve been set up. We need to get Coulson and Talbot out of there now.
Chen: Before we vote, I’d like to thank Dr. Lundwall for helping us to better understand inhumans.
Petrov: Yes.
Chen: If the vote is passed and the sanctuary state is approved, it will in no small part be each of…
Talbot: I’m sorry. I’m gonna have to postpone this vote. Guards! It has come to my attention that we have a traitor among us. Arrest this man.
Coulson: What the hell are you doing?!
Chen: What is the meaning of this, General?
Talbot: He’s been spying on us.
Coulson: Talbot, stop this.
Talbot: This man has violated our lives, he’s violated our rooms, and he’s violated our trust. He’s a liar, and a fraud. This man is not Dr. Sean Lundwall. His real name is…
Malick: This is Phil Coulson. The Director of HYDRA.
Coulson: You’re inside man.
Talbot: Kumbaya.
Hunter: I hate to be a buzzkill, but this is a gun-free zone, so I’m gonna have to take that off you.
May: Hunter, what’s going on?
Hunter: They’ve got Talbot’s son.
May: What?
Hunter: I’m pretty sure it’s him, in one of those gel-matrix cubes.
May: Malick. He’s blackmailing Talbot.
Hunter: Why would he do that?
May: To betray Coulson.
Morse: Standard-issue HYDRA. Print detection so no one else can use it.
May: Great. Coulson’s in trouble, the place is crawling with armed HYDRA Agents, and we have no weapons.
Hunter: Not strictly true.
Hunter: Buon appetito.
Morse: I love you.
May: I don’t hate you quite as much.
May: You two, find Coulson and Talbot. I’ll find Talbot’s son.
Lincoln: We can’t save everyone, Daisy. And not everyone who can change should change. That’s why Jiaying was so selective at Afterlife.
Daisy: She was also crazy.
Lincoln: Not about this. There is a balance that has to be maintained. Things are getting way out of whack. A-a vaccine might not be a bad thing.
Daisy: Do you even hear what you’re saying? You sound like one of those hate groups that’s been trolling the Internet… the… the watchdogs or whatever they’re calling themselves. “Kill the aliens and take back the planet.”
Lincoln: That’s not what this is about. It’s about giving people a choice.
Daisy: It’s a birthright. It is not a choice. And maybe things are getting out of whack because it’s our time.
Lincoln: Do you think it was lash’s time? Was it his birthright? Don’t you think Dr. Garner would have liked to have had a choice?
Daisy: All I know is that if the government got their hands on a vaccine, it won’t be a choice. They will wipe us out. We do not have a disease, Lincoln.
Lincoln: Technically, it is a disease. I studied this. Any disturbance of structure or function of the body…
Daisy: Oh, boy, someone went to med school, so, everyone, shut up and listen.
Lincoln: Yeah, I wasn’t hacking my way through life.
Malick: Some of you know me. You know that I served on the world security council. You know the good works that my foundations do. Some of you don’t know me yet, but you will. We’ll work together to do good for the world. But what do you know of Phil Coulson, a man who claims to feel compassionately about these inhumans? Let’s peel away some of the layers and see what’s inside. Phil Coulson is no friend to the inhumans. In fact, he’d like to exterminate them, which is why he was trying to manipulate this group into putting them all in one place.
Coulson: He’s lying. That’s not what I want, that’s what he wants.
Malick: You’re all welcome to believe him, but my reputation speaks for itself. This is a gel-matrix tank. Mr. Coulson developed the technology to keep the inhumans in suspended animation, but, in fact, with a mere flick of a switch, from any remote location, he can shut them off, killing them instantly. I think we’ve had enough of Mr. Coulson. Let’s lock him up until the officials arrive.
Coulson: What did he do? Who does he have? Talbot!
Giyera: These are the healthiest we could find. Lucio has frozen them in place for you. I hope they’re acceptable.
Hive: Yes. Well done.
Giyera: One will be your host?
Hive: I have a better use for them.
Lucio (in Spanish): They’re innocent.
Hive: Yes, they are innocents. But they will serve the greater good.
Coulson: You gentlemen interested in changing jobs? Good guys are hiring. You don’t get to kill people in cold blood, but we got a really good retirement plan. Where’s your boss? Didn’t have the guts to do this himself?
Malick: Yes. But I also have money to pay people to do my menial jobs.
Talbot: All right, I kept my end of the bargain. I delivered Coulson. All the delegates are on your side. Now give me back my son.
Coulson: Malick, you son of a bitch.
Malick: I’m sorry. I can’t do that.
Talbot: No. We had a deal!
Malick: Yes, but, unfortunately, you must all be sacrificed to the greater good.
Coulson: Why go to all this trouble?
Malick: I’m building an army.
Coulson: And another army will stand to fight them. You won’t be able to convert them all.
Malick: I won’t have to. Kill them.
Talbot: Do me a favor and shoot him first. I’d like one moment of peace before I go.
Coulson: You didn’t know he was gonna double-cross you? He is HYDRA, just sayin’.
Talbot: I knew he’s… do you think I don’t know? Do you think I’m stupid?
Coulson: Then what are you doing in here? Doesn’t seem like a very smart plan.
Talbot: I have an inside man. Like I said, I trust him with my life. Where’s my son?
Creel: He’s still with HYDRA. Hunter found him, but he almost blew my cover. I had to hurt him. A little.
Talbot: Come on. Open this thing up. Bust these cuffs off us.
Creel: Go on! Get out of here!
Coulson: Give me a hand!
Talbot: Got it! Let’s go! 
Talbot: What do you want to do with this hand? It’s kind of freaking me out.
Coulson: Stop, stop. Give me that. Why didn’t you tell me Malick had George?
Talbot: I couldn’t. He took him as soon as I was appointed to the ATCU. Told me he’d kill him with the push of a button if I told anybody. He’s the kind of guy who would do exactly that.
Coulson: And Carla?
Talbot: She knows. She blames me. I sent her someplace safe.
Coulson: Come on. We’re gonna fix this. We’re gonna fix everything.
Hunter: Were we the only ones that got the “no weapons” memo?
Morse: I’m bored of this. Cover me.
Hunter: We’re in the conference room. No sign of Coulson or Tal… That doesn’t make us even.
Talbot: Creel! Where’s my son? Where’s my son?!
Man: I don’t know.
Coulson: I need you to find Malick. There’s only one road between here and the airfield, so there’s a chance he hasn’t left. If you find him, stay with him. I want to know where he’s going. The rest of us will focus on trying to find Talbot’s son.
May: Yeah, Coulson, about that.
Daisy: I’m sorry. Sorry I got a little militant about the vaccine. I-I don’t know what’s going on with me right now.
Lincoln: You know, I’m envious of you.
Daisy: Why is that?
Lincoln: You have this natural Zen thing with your powers. Maybe you got it from your mom or hanging around May. Whatever it is, I wish I had it.
Daisy: What are you talking about? You were like… you were like the Zen master when we were at afterlife.
Lincoln: It was easy there. No stress, no fear. Here, not so much.
Daisy: Well, maybe I can help you.
Lincoln: I don’t know if it can be helped. For you, controlling your power is like finding peace. For me, it’s a… a war inside my head. I just don’t want to lose control.
Daisy: Sometimes, it’s good to lose control.
Coulson: He’s gonna be okay. He just needs some rest. He won’t remember any of it. Carla would be very happy to know you made it right.
Talbot: Well, I had a little help.
Coulson: That’s what partners are for, you know?
Talbot: Call me Glenn. Occasionally.
Coulson: I’ll leave you alone now. I informed our agents down under about Ellen King’s inhuman. They managed to get him out. He’s still sedated, but getting treatment.
May: Any word from Bobbi or Hunter?
Coulson: Not yet, but I’ll keep trying. There’s one more thing.
May: What?
Coulson: Malick is supposed to be the last head of HYDRA, but I can’t shake this feeling that he’s reporting to someone else.
May: Someone more powerful than Malick?
Coulson: Someone or something.
Malick: I hope your experience with Coulson didn’t sour you. It’s still a noble and worthwhile idea, and I’d like to help you any way that I can.
Petrov: Thank you, Mr. Malick, and thank you for this incredible ride home.
Malick: It’s my pleasure, anything for a friend.
Petrov: There are a few obstacles in my country, but with your influence, we should be able to work them all out, and then we shall have our sanctuary state.
Malick: To a place where all inhumans can live peacefully and not have to worry about the likes of Coulson.
Petrov: Cheers to that.
Coulson: Hunter, Bobbi, are you there? Come in. Over.
Hunter: Sorry. Can’t talk right now, boss. We’re in the belly of the beast. We’ll call you when we land. Wherever that may be.
