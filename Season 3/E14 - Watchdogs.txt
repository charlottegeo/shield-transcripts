Ruben: Sure that’s the right move, Alfie?
Mack: Ah, you know what’s not the right move? Calling me Alfie. Mom gets to. You don’t. If you’re gonna ride this thing like a damn maniac, I wouldn’t have to come home and repair it for you.
Ruben: You wish you rode like me.
Mack: Yeah, please. You got nothing to ride without that intake valve I brought you. I could always take it back.
Ruben: Okay. Well, your Ironhead’s in great shape, and you’re never home to ride it anyway. Maybe I ought to…
Mack: Never ride my bike ever? Yeah, I love that idea.
Ruben: I mean, I thought you were gonna finally ride it when we drove to Baja. Baja.
Mack: Oh, this again. Look, I told you, I got buried in work. All right, I’m sorry, but, uh… we’ll find a time.
Ruben: Oh, I understand. Being an insurance-company drone is super interesting. Why not bury yourself in that work?
Mack: Funny. I was wishing I was back at work right now.
Ruben: Seems like a pretty sweet gig if it gets you a hook-up on an impossible-to-find intake valve.
Mack: Yeah, honestly, job hasn’t been great lately. Management’s out of control, new people keep coming in every day, no experience. And the two friends I was closest to, they just got, uh… transferred for good.
Ruben: Work buddies, come and go. Now, family, they’re the ones you can’t get rid of. Even if they set up a roadside stand and tried selling you off to strangers.
Mack: You were an awkward kid.
Ruben: I’m sorry about your work.
Mack: I’m sorry about your layoff. But it’s just a temporary setback.
Mack: Why is this still here? When Mom and Dad left you the house, they had to leave this, too?
Ruben: Dad wouldn’t let Mom take it. I put it up on eBay. Turns out, not as valuable as Mom thinks.
Mack: Okay, uh, so here’s the plan. Uh, lunch, beers, finish up the bike. Good?
Ruben: Good. I picked up a couple steaks.
Mack: No, you didn’t. You gonna do your…?
Ruben: Mm-hmm.
Ruben: Aw, yeah.
Mack: You could take a run at that, you know, cooking. You’re good. No, I’m serious. Not as good as I am with engines, but…
Ruben: Oh, that was almost a compliment. So close.
Reporter: Breaking news…
Ruben: I’ve thought about it, but…
Reporter: We have a shocking video that was sent to our station minutes ago.
Watchdog: This facility s controlled by the ATCU. The government is keeping secrets, things we don’t know until cities fall out of the sky. The Avengers, more like them every day, protected, hidden. Not anymore! We want this information released…
Ruben: Whoa.
Watchdog: A list of who they are, where they are. Or you will have war on your hands. We are the Watchdogs. You will obey. Let’s go!
Mack: This is…
Ruben: Awesome. Right?
Coulson: I need an agent in South Bend, and you’re the closest one to the scene.
Mack: Right. It’s just, I’m here with my brother, and I was hoping this week off would be more of a…
Coulson: Thing is, Mack, I’m actually down a couple of agents right now.
Mack: I know, sir.
Coulson: My resources are limited. Local P.D.’s already on the scene, and you know the Feds are on a plane.
Mack: Yes, but…
Coulson: They’ll pick the site clean, and we’ll have nothing. They hit the ATCU, Mack. It’s serious. I’m sorry about family time, but we all make sacrifices. Figure it out.
Mack: Hey, uh… So, it looks like I have to take off for a couple of hours. There was an accident on U.S. 41. I got to go assess it.
Ruben: Now?
Mack: Yeah. It’s complicated.
Ruben: But this is simple. Lunch, beers, bike? Remember?
Mack: We’ll get to it. I promise.
Daisy: Were there casualties?
Coulson: The building had a staff. When you get to South Bend, rendezvous with Mack at the ATCU site. Report back what you got.
Daisy: I’ve been following the Watchdogs online for a while now. Some pretty nasty hate speech, but up until now, it’s all been rhetoric.
Coulson: There’s a bark/bite joke I could make here, but I don’t find these guys all that funny.
Daisy: No, they’ve had a menacing presence ever since New York. Got even less funny after Sokovia.
Fitz: Not exactly embracing the new changes in the world.
Coulson: Now they’re not happy just being the comments section.
Daisy: Something’s changed. They’re taking action.
Coulson: We need to shut them down before more people get hurt. We’ve got enough on our plate trying to track down Malick.
Daisy: Hey!
Lincoln: Hey.
Daisy: How’d the S.H.I.E.L.D. assessment go?
Lincoln: Fine, I think. I guess we won’t know for sure till Coulson gets the evaluation report.
Coulson: I got it.
Daisy: Well, should we bring Lincoln with us? With Bobbi and Hunter gone, we can use all the help.
Coulson: Lincoln’s gonna sit this one out. You and Fitz go ahead. Meet up with Mack, then report back to me.
Daisy: Okay. I will do that.
Mack: We get it, Watchdogs, you did this.
Daisy: Yeah. Did you ride that here?
Mack: Uh-huh.
Daisy: Wow. You really are on vacation.
Mack: Yeah. Vacation. All right, here’s what we know so far. This facility was a storage site for the ATCU.
Daisy: But somehow, the Watchdogs found out.
Fitz: Hey! Hey. Uh, the residue from the bombs, it’s got nitramene in it.
Daisy: I don’t know what that is, but your tone of voice makes it sound bad.
Fitz: Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II. It causes implosions.
Mack: Mm. That’s weird.
Daisy: Weird how? That they got their hands on it?
Mack: Nitramene isn’t stable enough to be used in a gel-based explosive. Or at least it shouldn’t be.
Fitz: So the Watchdogs have been making improvements to nitramene.
Daisy: J-just to be clear, nitramene…
Fitz: Actually, I think I’ve got some sodium hydrogen acetate back on Zephyr One.
Mack: That’ll help if we encounter any more bombs, right.
Daisy: Sodium…
Fitz: Hydrogen acetate.
Mack & Fitz: Neutralizes nitramene.
Daisy: Okay. Thank you, Nerd Herd. I’m gonna go call Coulson.
Mack: Do we take this debris back with us, study it?
Fitz: Uh, yeah, sure. If… if you’ve been working out. ‘Cause it weighs like 100,000 tons. It’s a building.
Mack: So… no, then.
Coulson: Nitramene.
Daisy: Why does that mean something to everyone else but me?
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D. history. Stark tech. And I knew somebody once who was keen on improving the original formula.
Daisy: Okay, well, is that enough to connect that person to the Watchdogs?
Coulson: He was fixated on it. Thought it might be something we could add to our arsenal.
Daisy: Our arsenal? A-Are you saying this could be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
Coulson: A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent you’ve met. A good man, but he went off the grid when he got out of the hospital, which means he’s at large with a lot of our secrets.
Daisy: He was in the hospital?
Coulson: After Deathlok broke his spine.
Blake: Nice work out there, boys.
Coulson: Felix Blake.
Blake: Gentlemen, I’ve got a new plan of attack. And it’s a good one.
May: Someone’s been practicing.
Simmons: You know I don’t like guns, but I’d rather be prepared.
May: Good. You’re holding your breath, though. Exhale when you pull the trigger.
Simmons: Thanks.
May: Want to tell me what this is about?
Simmons: Do I need to?
May: You don’t like feeling vulnerable. Sick of blaming yourself for…
Simmons: No, I’m quite comfortable blaming myself, actually, for the lot of it. For all the miseries endured to rescue helpless little Agent Simmons. Will died trying to save me. And Fitz… Poor Fitz nearly got himself killed a number of times, and that’s not even the worst of it.
May: Andrew. What happened to those Inhumans, not your fault.
Simmons: No, I just let a known murderer loose to save my own skin. Traded all those… those lives for mine. Well, it won’t happen again. And since I’m practically the only woman here who can’t kill with her bare hands…
May: Listen to me. That wasn’t your fault.
Mack: What makes them go from anonymous trash-talking online to…
Daisy: Domestic terrorism? Maybe someone stepped in and radicalized them. Maybe Blake.
Fitz: I understand feeling lost. You want to hate something. Hate gives you direction. That could be dangerous.
Mack: Hey, I used to hate all this alien crap. Uh, used to. But my brother thinks that way. I mean, he’s a good guy, but even he’s cheering on the Watchdogs.
Daisy: They’re not… they’re not that anonymous. I’ve been tracking them, the ones that are spewing hate online. You know, IP addresses, residences, license-plate numbers, some of them are local. They could’ve been involved in the ATCU attack. We should go pick one up and see what he knows.
Mack: And what? Shake him down? Without even knowing if the guy we picked was actually involved?
Daisy: Well, either way, he’ll know something.
Mack: Yeah, but it’s kind of Gestapo, don’t you think? Is that who we are?
Daisy: We’re S.H.I.E.L.D. I’m trying to save lives. I’ll use whatever advantage I have to do it.
Mack: Yeah, the advantage of superpowers, which is something I don’t have. But I’m not so sure you should be using yours to sidestep civil liberties.
Daisy: They gave up their right to civil liberties when they started imploding buildings.
Mack: Maybe, but it’s not about how they act. It’s about how we respond. All right, look, I’m not going along with this. Besides, I made a promise to my brother.
Daisy: Okay, Fitz, you’re with me.
Fitz: Uh, am I?
Lincoln: You’re looking for me?
Coulson: Yeah. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. While he’s out there causing casualties, he’s our top priority.
Lincoln: Okay. How can I…
Coulson: I worked with the guy. I know a few things he doesn’t know I know.
Lincoln: You mean that’ll help you find him.
Coulson: Everyone has safehouses. Unbeknownst to Blake, I happen to know where a few of his are, and that’s not to help me find him. It’s to help us find him.
Lincoln: Wait. You’re saying I’m going, too.
Coulson: I am. If we can find any evidence he left behind of his plans, we can stop him.
Lincoln: Okay. Great. I mean… You… you didn’t say anything about my evaluation, so… You know, it just seemed like you weren’t happy with what you saw.
Coulson: I’m not. But I want to see it for myself.
Ruben: Saving the world, one diligently assessed insurance claim at a time. The gecko and his sidekick, Alfie. Oh, wait. You work for the lady with the funny hair. I always forget.
Mack: So I guess you had your beers.
Ruben: And yours, too. You weren’t drinking ‘em.
Mack: I get that you’re upset. But… All right, look, you got to make sure the valve seats right…
Ruben: It’s not about the damn bikes!
Mack: Okay. Then what’s it about?
Ruben: Nothing, man.
Mack: Nothing? Really? So you’re just being a jackass for no reason?
Ruben: There’s just a lot going on. Health benefits are about to run out. There’s zero jobs out there. The mortgage isn’t in great shape.
Mack: Wait, wait a minute. What about the mortgage?
Ruben: I’m upside down.
Mack: Damn it.
Ruben: I’ve been trying, okay? But I was already struggling, then the layoffs happened…
Mack: Wait, wait, wait. So is that why you’ve been wanting me to hang out? You know, get some brother time, go to Baja. What, you just wanted to ask me for money?
Ruben: No! I suggested Baja because we’ve been talking about it since we were kids. And, by the way, I never asked for money. I’ll handle it. Like I handle everything, like with Mom and Dad…
Mack: I help out. I helped you move them into the condo.
Ruben: You showed up three days after I moved them in. Even now, I’m the one that has to keep everything here afloat. We can’t all just run off to some other…
Mack: No one put a gun to your head! You didn’t have to take this house. You could’ve sold it.
Ruben: But I didn’t. And now I’m in default. I can’t afford the house. I can’t afford to leave. This is how they get you. System’s rigged. They want to keep you down and in the dark, man.
Mack: Hey. You sound like those Watchdog nuts.
Ruben: Well, they got the right idea. Someone’s got to fight back. The government controls everything. “You either rise up in protest, or you fall down in chains.”
Mack: That’s a direct quote. Are you reading their stuff?
Ruben: I go online. They get what I’m going through. You don’t. You’re only here 'cause your friends left.
Mack: You stay away from the Watchdogs! You hear me? They’re not the answer.
Ruben: No? Well, what is the answer? You?
May: Simmons. Here. Everything I have.
Simmons: You’re pursuing Andrew.
May: And I’ve retasked a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to look for him.
Simmons: I can’t imagine how hard this must…
May: Has to be done. Because Andrew is dangerous. You’re not responsible. He is.
Simmons: I just feel guilty, all the time. How do you make it stop?
May: You don’t. You use it, channel it.
Simmons: Is that what you’re doing? I can help.
May: Was hoping you would.
Simmons: Oh, you’re doing this wrong. I mean, you’re looking in the wrong place.
Lincoln: So, uh, this Blake guy, he has safehouses, what, all over?
Coulson: All agents do. We’ll just have to keep checking his until we find something.
Lincoln: So, what did it say, on my evaluation?
Coulson: Nothing that’ll surprise you. You’re here for Daisy, not the cause. So commitment is a question.
Lincoln: But I am here.
Coulson: And your control issues didn’t stop with A.A. You went nuclear on Lash, on Creel.
Lincoln: I had reasons both times.
Coulson: But you didn’t follow orders. You can’t just be at S.H.I.E.L.D. You have to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Lincoln: And I’m trying to be, but you don’t make it easy. There’s a test at every turn. I mean, this is a test.
Coulson: This is a chance for me to see for myself how you handle things.
Lincoln: Same thing, different words…
Coulson: Don’t interrupt me! You got it? You haven’t earned that right yet. I don’t know you. I vetted every member of this team except you, measured their commitment to this ideal, including two good agents who just gave it all up to protect that ideal. I think you could be a good agent, but I need to know if you think that and that you want it badly enough. So you stay in control and you follow my orders, and I’ll decide if you get to be an agent or not. Understood?
Lincoln: Yes, sir.
Woman: I’m just saying, first, it was the illegal aliens. Now it’s actual aliens putting us all at risk?
Wyatt: Mm-hmm!
Woman: And we do need to be tracking them. We have to take our country back.
Wyatt: What the hell?
Daisy: Hi, Dallas.
Wyatt: How do you know who I am?
Daisy: You think I can’t find out who you are when you’re online talking about rounding up freaks just because we’re not face-to-face? Now we’re face-to-face, and I’m one of the freaks. But I guess that part was clear. I know they’ve contacted you. Want you to take action, and no doubt, you’ve chickened out, but I need you to tell me where they meet.
Wyatt: I’m not telling you anything. Please… Ple-please don’t hurt me.
Daisy: I won’t have to if you tell me what I want to know. So talk.
Daisy: They’re all gathered at a place called Easterling Farms. They’re prepping for their next attack.
Mack: How’d you get the information?
Daisy: I found someone who was willing to talk. Look, the point is, if we leave now, we can stop anyone else from getting hurt. That’s still the mission, isn’t it?
Mack: Easterling Farms. That’s over in, uh… uh, Lake County, right?
Daisy: Yeah. I’ll text you the location.
Mack: I’ll meet you there. There’s nothing for me to do here anyway.  Hey, Ruben. I didn’t know you were home.
Ruben: I went out. For a bit.
Mack: Well, I, uh… I laid out all the parts for the bike. They’re in the right order. All you have to do is install them.
Ruben: Thanks. I’m making lunch. Bolognese. Veal and pork, if you want some.
Mack: Yeah, that sounds good, but, um… I have a thing, so…
Simmons: Andrew isn’t like your other targets. He’s an Inhuman, and an unusual one at that. Andrew, or Lash, really is perhaps being driven by different factors, biological imperatives, for instance. Climate, feeding, even his need to seek out…
May: Seek out intended victims.
Simmons: Yes. He’s being driven by base instincts.
May: So you’re saying I should think less like a spy, more like a doctor.
Simmons: Exactly. May, what happens to Andrew when you catch up to him?
May: After everything, I’m going to kill him. He’s left us no choice.
Simmons: What if there is a choice?
May: There’s not.
Simmons: May… Fitz and I have been working on the vaccine from Creel’s blood. Now, it would only work on Inhumans who haven’t turned yet, but Andrew hasn’t finished his transition. Shouldn’t we at least try?
May: No. Don’t give me hope, Jemma. I don’t want hope.
Mack: It’d be nice if we weren’t quite so out in the open.
Daisy: Speaking of…
Fitz: Hey.
Daisy: Let’s see what the Watchdogs look like in their natural habitat.
Blake: … which means only designated team captains will carry a full tactical pack. Know your captain, and if you get in trouble, signal him.
Daisy: That’s Blake’s voice. That’s him. He’s here.
Lincoln: What are we looking for?
Coulson: Anything that might be evidence of what Blake is doing. You hear that?
Blake: We don’t want to hurt innocents.
Fitz: Still trying to get eyes on Blake.
Blake: You have permission to defend yourself. The mission comes first.
Mack: Ruben.
Ruben: Al, look! Good as new!
Mack: Ruben, go home. Go home!
Ruben: What’re you doing?
Fitz: What does he think you do?
Mack: Insurance.
Fitz: Well, not anymore, I wager.
Daisy: Mack, we’ve got to get him out of here.
Oscar: Did you see what that guy just did?
Victor: I’ll tell the boss.
Mack: We’re done. Go to black.
Daisy: No, no, we can still…
Mack: There are too many! Go to black! Are you good to get out of here? I’ve got to go put a lid on this.
Daisy: Yeah. Yeah, we got it.
Daisy: Go.
Fitz: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What’re you doing? We said we’d fall back.
Daisy: I have a shot at stopping Blake. I’m taking it. Call the module. I’ll be back.
Man: Let’s go! Let’s go! Move it! Come on! Come on!
Daisy: Where are you, Blake? It’s like he disappeared.
Coulson: Blake? How are you here?
Blake: I’m everywhere, Coulson. As are you, apparently.
Coulson: You recovered well.
Blake: Says the man who came back from the dead. I guess we both have a few tricks up our sleeve, old friend.
Fitz: Aah!
Daisy: Fitz! Fitz! What’s that… what’s the stuff called? Sodium what?
Fitz: Sodium hydrogen acetate.
Fitz: What?
Daisy: I don’t think it’s working.
Fitz: Maybe we slowed it down, but… must be the modifications that Blake made.
Daisy: What does that mean?
Fitz: That sooner or later, this bomb is gonna go off. And then I’ll implode. Which is gonna be messy.
Blake: So here we are, reunited at last.
Coulson: I got to admit, it’s not what I’d hoped for.
Blake: I really thought it’d be ATCU proper who showed up at the compound. Didn’t expect you.
Coulson: I’m working with the ATCU.
Blake: You mean keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. alive within it. Those survival instincts of yours, Coulson, always impressive.
Coulson: I searched for you. I wanted to make you part of the new S.H.I.E.L.D.
Blake: Yeah, well, when I got out of the hospital, it turned out there had never been a S.H.I.E.L.D., just Hydra hiding behind one. I signed up to protect the world from these dangerous alien elements.
Coulson: We still do that.
Blake: The hell you do. You use them, unleash them. You’ve got those freaks working for you. Hell, Phil, you are one. Makes me sick.
Coulson: We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. protects mankind.
Blake: And what has S.H.I.E.L.D. done in the name of protection? We brought the Chitauri to Earth. I was taken out by one of your cybernetic recruits. And the latest and greatest idea? The Avengers created Ultron.
Coulson: What are you doing, Blake?
Blake: I’m trying to make the world a safer place…
Coulson: No. What are you doing now? Here? I know your tactics. Speeches? Not one of them. You’re stalling. Why?
Daisy: Everyone stay back! Clear the area! It’s digging into your skin.
Fitz: Yep. I’m very well-aware, so cutting it off is not an option.
Daisy: I’ll quake it off.
Fitz: No, no, no! It’s too unstable. Okay, I don’t want to get her involved, but I think we should phone Simmons.
Daisy: We’ve got a better way to get the info.
Fitz: Okay. I was wondering why you… you brought him here.
Daisy: What did your people put in the bomb? Tell us what you did!
Oscar: I don’t know.
Daisy: Talk or implode.
Oscar: It was you.
Daisy: You’re not getting out of here until you give us answers.
Oscar: I-I don’t know. I’m not a scientist.
Fitz: Yeah, obviously.
Oscar: Whatever Blake did to suspend the stuff in there, he didn’t tell me.
Fitz: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on. “Suspend,” that’s a science word that he wouldn’t know. The… the… the nitramene is suspended. It’s like… it’s like a vaccination. That’s why we can’t get to it.
Daisy: What do we do?
Fitz: Uh… We need to stop the substance housing the nitramene. Uh, it’s a liquid, so… We could freeze it.
Daisy: How?
Fitz: Liquid nitrogen. There’s, um… we use it in the cooling jets on the containment module. There’s a panel in the corner!
Blake: Your team in Indiana, very industrious. Problem is, that’s just one cell. This is nationwide.
Coulson: Tell me something. How’d you get that ATCU target? Was it fed to you? This has HYDRA’s fingerprints all over it. Don’t you see? You were probably cleaning up some mess of theirs.
Blake: How did you get the location of our compound? Coercion, by any chance? I’m sure it was all aboveboard.
Coulson: We’re solving problems, not making them.
Blake: We’re spreading an idea.
Lincoln: You spread fear.
Blake: People are already afraid, and they want the truth.
Coulson: What you’re doing’s not about truth. It’s about hate.
Blake: And you’re above that? You’ve never just killed someone because you hate them, Phil? Hate’s a good motivator.
Coulson: You’re not wrong. This guy? He’s also filled with hate, and he happens to be one of the Inhumans you’re railing against.
Blake: Really? Interesting.
Coulson: He wants to hurt you, badly. In fact, the only reason he’s not is because he’s trying really hard to follow my orders. So, I’m changing my orders.
Lincoln: What?
Coulson: Don’t hurt Agent Blake. Kill him.
Lincoln: Sir?
Coulson: That’s an order.
Lincoln: Sir, there’s got to be another way.
Blake: Uh-oh, Coulson. Seems your puppy doesn’t have his teeth yet.
Coulson: Lincoln, sometimes we do the wrong thing for the right reason because it has to be done. Now take him out.
Blake: Oh, no. Dissent among the ranks…
Lincoln: What the…? He was a hologram.
Coulson: Uh-huh.
Daisy: Okay. Here we go. You ready? Okay. It’s working. Fitz. It’s working! I’m turning you over to the ATCU. I have a feeling General Talbot will have some questions for you.
Lincoln: You knew he wasn’t really here.
Coulson: Yeah, he wasn’t moving much. There was also a lag. Blake usually interrupts you a lot more. I also know that wasn’t a kill shot. I saw you with Lash.
Lincoln: Yeah, I just…
Coulson: You did it right. Offered a dissenting opinion, but when the time came, you did what I asked. Well, a slightly less lethal version. Well-done.
Lincoln: We should go through this place, find out if there really is a second target. Blake will send his men.
Ruben: Who are you?
Mack: I know it’s a lot to take in, but we if we could talk about it…
Ruben: Oh, sure. Now you want to talk. I can’t believe you, helping those freaks…
Mack: Look, that’s not what they are. They’re Inhumans.
Ruben: “Inhumans?”
Mack: There’s nothing to be afraid of.
Ruben: What in the hell does that even…
Mack: They’re people! And they’re being hunted.
Ruben: You know, the really stupid part is, I was actually gonna apologize to you, for not telling you about the house, for hiding things. God, I’m an idiot.
Mack: The reason I didn’t tell you is because I…
Ruben: Stop talking! You’re a liar. It’s all lies.
Lincoln: Daisy should be able to access these.
Coulson: Were they preparing for a second target? He was stalling.
Lincoln: But why?
Coulson: To keep us distracted, but from what?
Lincoln: From talking to our people?
Coulson: But we’d already sent agents to his… to his compound.
Lincoln: Blake kept talking about you working with freaks. He must’ve known that you’d send some of us on the raid.
Coulson: He didn’t have a second target. He wanted one, an Inhuman, someone for his men to go after.
Lincoln: We brought him Daisy.
Daisy: What?
Oscar: It was all talk for so long. “Get a powered person and kill it.” But then you all were there, and we got to see a real, live freak fire a shock wave. Only thing is, we didn’t think it was a tiny, unassuming little girl. If we did, we’d have gone after you instead.
Fitz: What do you mean “instead?”
Ruben: Why didn’t you just tell me?!
Mack: It’s complicated.
Ruben: It’s always complicated with you.
Mack: Ruben, I wanted to keep you away from all this. That’s true of the Watchdogs, too. You’re angry and aimless, but I didn’t want them roping…
Ruben: Better than being blindsided!
Mack: You don’t believe that.
Ruben: What do you know about me? You’ve been so busy protecting freaks, you haven’t even…
Mack: Not just them! People! Damn it, that’s why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D. To protect the people I care about, to protect you.
Ruben: What was that?
Watchdog: All right! Let’s kill this freak!
Mack: They torched our bikes. We can’t get away. Looks like the Watchdogs followed us. I guess now we’re the ones being hunted.
Ruben: But we’re not…
Mack: Inhumans? It doesn’t matter. Your new heroes will still kill us.
Ruben: Can’t we just make a break for it?
Mack: No, that’s not a good idea. It’s too wide open out front. They’ll pick us off before we get too far.
Ruben: So what do we do?
Mack: I’m thinking.
Watchdog: Search all the rooms. Check upstairs.
Mack: Wait. Can’t be more than five.
Watchdog: They got to be here somewhere.
Mack: And they’re spread out. Okay, um. Did… did Dad take his shotgun with him to the Florida condos?
Ruben: No, it’s still there. He doesn’t have any slugs, just bird shot.
Mack: That’ll work. All right. Back of the house is woods, so that’s the new goal. We get to the backdoor in the kitchen. Then we slip out into the woods and escape.
Ruben: So, this is what you do at S.H.I.E.L.D.? Hmm? This kind of stuff?
Mack: Ruben, I’m a mechanic. I hate this stuff.
Ruben: You’ve made it dark.
Mack: I have.
Ruben: Won’t that make it hard for us to see them coming?
Mack: Yeah. But it also means they won’t be able to see us. And we know our way around this house with our eyes closed.
Watchdog: Aah!
Mack: The rest’ll be coming now, so stay alert. You ever use one of these before?
Ruben: An assault rifle?
Mack: Yeah.
Ruben: No. Obviously, you have. Talk me through it.
Mack: If it moves, shoot it. And try not to shoot yourself. Or me. I’ll clear the entryway. You follow.
Mack: We got to go. Hey, hey! Hey, stay… step away from the door. How many shooters did you see upstairs?
Ruben: Just the one.
Mack: Are you sure? Then we only found three Watchdogs. Where are the other two?
Ruben: So that’s it. We can go out the…
Mack: Shh. They must’ve figured out this was our escape route. They’re waiting for us.
Ruben: Did they see us?
Mack: No. If they did, they would’ve been in here by now. They’re gonna be a problem if we want to get out of here. Look, we need…
Ruben: No!
Ruben: That lock won’t hold. What the hell are you doing?
Mack: Shotgun axe.
Watchdog: Aah!
Ruben: You beat them. You did that.
Mack: This is why I didn’t tell you.
Ruben: He’ll be okay?
Daisy: Yeah, yeah. He’ll be fine. They’re taking him to a facility nearby. It’s one of ours. I’ll drive you. You all right?
Ruben: I’ve never… All those men, here, he had to shoot them to…
Daisy: I know, I know. It’s a lot to take in. But you’re safe now. But S.H.I.E.L.D. will take all the wounded men into custody, and Damage Control will clean up.
Ruben: S.H.I.E.L.D. Alfie works for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Daisy: He’s one of the best. Did you just call him “Alfie?” Wow. Thank you. I cannot wait for him to get back from recovery now.
Ruben: What do you call him?
Daisy: Mack.
Ruben: That’s what my buddies call me. He said his friends took off?
Daisy: Yeah. Yeah. But not all of them. And now that you know about us, we might give you a ring. Your brother says you’re a good wheel man.
Ruben: And you’re his partner.
Daisy: Yeah. And I should’ve been here for him. I could’ve stopped them.
Ruben: He seemed to handle things fine. He’s good at it? Saving people?
Daisy: When I need someone to watch my back, he’s the person I want.
Ruben: Okay. Good.
Daisy: You still want that ride, Mini Mack?
Daisy: You were right. The ATCU attack was a cover. Found surveillance video. This is about an hour before the implosion. We ran the plates. Company car.
Coulson: Malick?
Daisy: You win.
Coulson: This wasn’t an act of terrorism. It was a distraction and a cover-up.
Daisy: Sponsored by HYDRA. Malick’s firing up the Watchdogs, feeding them intel.
Coulson: If they got that kind of funding, they’re not going anywhere. And Malick? God only knows what he took from there.
Blake: I kept my part of the deal. Now I expect you to keep yours. I want weaponry. And not that Stark Industries reissue crap. I’m talking about the big guns. So we can finally hunt down these freaks.
Giyera: Yes. Freaks. If everything goes as planned, we’ll all get what we want, Mr. Blake. Our common enemies will be dead, and you’ll have troops, armed to the teeth, at your command.
Blake: Yeah. Sounds right.
