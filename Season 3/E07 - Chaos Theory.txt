May: Did you just spoil a perfect moment by capturing it?
Andrew: You looked too good, sun hitting you like that. Ha!
May: You know, this time tomorrow, we’ll be home.
Andrew: Look who’s spoiling the moment now.
May: What would you say if I didn’t go back to S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Andrew: You’re serious?
May: At least, not right away.
Andrew: So, is this the island talking, or are you… I mean…
May: There are a lot of reasons why this won’t work. Why we won’t work.
Andrew: Somehow I forgot how direct you are.
May: I don’t want to be one of those reasons.
Andrew: And you won’t be. Listen, we’re older now and wiser. And I don’t plan on losing you a second time. So what do you say? Wanna to go steady?
May: Weren’t we just talking about how we’re older?
Andrew: Yes. All right, then. To new beginnings.
May: To new beginnings.
Andrew: I don’t know when Melinda’s coming back, Phil. We only got home a couple of days ago. Wanted to thank you for sending over Jiaying’s things from Afterlife.
Coulson: Hopefully, it’ll help shed some light on our new Inhuman situation.
Andrew: I’ll keep you posted if I find anything interesting. And, Phil, I wouldn’t wait for Melinda to call you.
Coulson: Good advice. Thanks.
Andrew: All right.
Andrew: Oh, god!
Daisy: We’re not monsters. You can’t just lock us up in some ice prison because you don’t know what else to do.
Coulson: No one’s talking prison. And, technically, it’s a gel matrix.
Daisy: They’re putting people in stasis!
Coulson: Think of it as a medically induced coma, a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution.
Daisy: “A better solution.” What does that mean?
Coulson: The ATCU’s looking for a cure. I’m not suggesting that’s for everyone, because it’s not, but some people might want to…
Daisy: We are not a disease.
Coulson: I didn’t say that you were.
Daisy: You can’t just expect people to go through that kind of change and immediately have a handle on it. Do you remember how scared I was at first?
Coulson: Yes. I also remember you ICEd yourself so that you wouldn’t hurt any of us. You’ve got to admit, things are getting out of hand.
Daisy: I know.
Coulson: People are changing in uncontrolled environments.
Daisy: I know, but everyone deserves a chance to be who they are.
Andrew: That’s where you’re wrong. You’re being seduced by your own experience. Just because you learned how to control your powers doesn’t mean everyone else will. I mean, what if a person’s hurting themselves or those around them? What … What if they can’t stop?
Coulson: Take Lash. If putting a bullet in that monster’s head doesn’t do the trick, then what?
Daisy: That’s not fair. That’s one guy. Most Inhumans fall somewhere between me and him.
Coulson: And that’s the message I’m hoping the president and his advisors will hear when I meet with them today.
Daisy: The President of the United States?
Coulson: It’s off the books, but the global community’s coming together to discuss the future of enhanced people. We’re meeting at Norad in Colorado.
Daisy: But S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t supposed to exist.
Coulson: That’s why I’m going in as a consultant for the ATCU.
Daisy: So Rosalind Price…
Coulson: Arranged it, yes. We’re taking Zephyr One, picking her up on the way.
Daisy: Are you sure this is a good idea?
Coulson: We can’t afford to miss it. That’s why I want you to talk to Rosalind before the meeting. Win her over to your side of things.
Andrew: Could be a real start toward legitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. But it might help if you can present a successful Inhuman case, one that’s not an extreme on either side.
Daisy: Joey Gutierrez is due for reassessment.
Andrew: I’d be more than happy to check in on him, see how he’s progressing.
Daisy: Couldn’t hurt.
Coulson: I agree.
Andrew: I can send you my report while you’re in the air.
Daisy: Thank you for your help on this.
Andrew: It’s what I’m here for.
Mack: No. I just don’t know why you’re calling me. All right. Give me your location. I’ll meet you there.
Simmons: Dr. Garner.
Andrew: Hey. Looks like you’re heading to the lab. That’s a good sign, right?
Simmons: I’m trying. We’re trying. Sometimes it just feels like it would’ve been best if I hadn’t told Fitz everything.
Andrew: You did the right thing in telling the truth, Jemma. Secrets can eat you up from the inside.
Simmons: You busy?
Fitz: Uh, no. No.
Simmons: Sorry I haven’t been in here more.
Fitz: There’s… There’s no need to explain. What’s that?
Simmons: It’s my phone. I had it with me. Uh, I took pictures, made some recordings to document my time there. It’s quite damaged, but I kept it on me as a remembrance. I was hoping you could…
Fitz: Recover the data.
Simmons: It’s probably pointless.
Fitz: Yeah, no. Maybe not.
Simmons: Just thought if you saw it for…
Fitz: Myself, yeah.
Simmons: I always felt better having you as my second pair of eyes.
Fitz: Well, couldn’t hurt to try. I’ll get right on it.
Simmons: Thank you, Fitz.
Strucker: But I didn’t know he’d change into that thing.
Morse: You worried about Andrew? Or pissed that the Strucker kid went comatose before he could talk? Well, everyone at H.Q. says that Andrew’s fine. And as far as HYDRA, we’ll get ‘em. I hope you stick around. HYDRA’s not the only thing we’re facing these days. Between the Inhumans, this monster we’re hunting, and the ATCU on our ass, we need all the help that we can get.
May: Monster?
Morse: Yeah. Big ugly thing, likes to kill other Inhumans.
May: You’ve been tracking him?
Morse: Trying. Transforms into a man, which makes him impossible to find.
Daisy: May! Hi. Oh, my god. It’s good to see you.
May: I-I gotta go.
Daisy: Go where?
May: I, uh, need to talk to Andrew.
Daisy: He’s doing a psych eval on one of the new Inhuman recruits.
May: I checked the containment room. He’s not…
Daisy: No, he’s at a training facility off-site.
May: Where?
Joey: I can actually create things now.
Andrew: And how does that make you feel?
Joey: Excited, you know. I have so much more control now.
Joey: Dr. Garner?
Andrew: Control. Yes. That’s important.
Joey: Daisy thinks I could be a real asset to S.H.I.E.L.D. But she said my fate is in your hands.
Andrew: Yes, Joey. It is.
Hunter: Don’t put your shirt on for my benefit. Heard about your HYDRA pool party. And here I was worried about you. Never liked Kebo much myself. Funny name. Locked me in a trunk. You all right?
Morse: Of course.
Hunter: Good. ‘Cause taking out some of Ward’s key players Brings us one step closer to finding the bastard.
Morse: No.
Hunter: Coulson’s busy with Daisy, so now is as good a time as any.
Morse: Hunter, it’s just… it’s not a good idea.
Hunter: Is this about Andrew? 'Cause I thought we were past all that, now that he’s all right, I mean. Okay. Did things get slightly out of control? Yes. But nothing I couldn’t handle, obviously. And everything I did was to protect you. Bob, will you stop for one second?
Morse: I don’t want either of us to go after Ward.
Hunter: You… You’re joking, right? Since when? Whatever it is, lay it on me.
Morse: I think you’ve been reckless and stupid.
Hunter: Can I take back what I just said?
Morse: And for what?
Hunter: So Ward won’t lay a bloody finger on you again! That’s what! Yeah, I’m stupid, because I love you!
Morse: I don’t need a knight in shining armor, Hunter. I need you alive. I don’t want to lose you.
Hunter: Okay. You’re right.
Morse: Or lose ourselves. Become so obsessed with revenge that we… we turn into monsters just like him.
Price: Never walked onto a flying base before. Guess I can cross that off my bucket list. So, where does the tour begin?
Coulson: That’s actually up to Daisy. She’s gonna show you around.
Coulson, May, Skye, Fitz: Happy birthday, Jemma!
Fitz: Happy birthday, Jemma. It’s not the same without you here. Say hi to your parents for me, and I’ll see you soon.
Fitz: Wow. Two moons. Bloody hell.
Simmons: Fitz. It’s possible I’m on one of the poles, but it’s strange. The stars and the two moons, they keep disappearing and reappearing. But there’s no sun. There’s never a sun.
Joey: Last time you saw me, I was a wreck. Now I feel… empowered. That probably sounds stupid.
Andrew: Sounds like you’ve grown to accept that this is a part of you.
Joey: Honestly, as a construction guy, the idea that I could build in a day something that would normally take months, it’s unreal.
Andrew: Or tear something down.
Joey: Yeah. If I have to. Just like that. Daisy’s trying to put together a team of soldiers, right? To fight.
Andrew: To fight evil.
Joey: I could be a real weapon against it.
Andrew: A dangerous weapon. That’s what I’m worried about.
Agent: We weren’t expecting anyone to…
Andrew: Melinda, what’s going on?
May: Take Mr. Gutierrez back to H.Q.
Andrew: Melinda, we’re in the middle of a session.
May: Not anymore! Do it now.
Agent: Ma'am, we have protocols.
May: Take care of them, then go. Come on.
Andrew: What’s all this about?
May: We need to talk, once we’re alone.
Lincoln: Thanks for coming.
Mack: You can settle down. No one knows we’re here. You getting any sleep?
Lincoln: It’s kind of hard when I’m being hunted nonstop. I’m really only worried about the one who wants to blast a hole through my chest.
Mack: If you’ve got intel on the guy, why not call Daisy?
Lincoln: 'Cause I can’t put her life at risk, too. I went looking for my friends. And those who aren’t missing are dead.
Mack: You’re telling me this why?
Lincoln: Because you fought by my side against that thing. It eliminates you as a suspect.
Mack: Why would I be a suspect?
Lincoln: 'Cause you’re with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Mack: Okay. I… I’m not sure I’m following.
Lincoln: Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D. And with your help, I can prove it.
Price: I appreciate you showing me around like this.
Daisy: We built this module to help those in transition. It’s made out of adaptive material, so it can contain all sorts of powers. It’s also bulletproof, which comes in handy when people like you shoot at people like me.
Price: And you really think this is more humane?
Daisy: Our goal is to observe people, educate them, and, yes, it can take time, but…
Price: We don’t always have that luxury.
Daisy: But throwing people away like they don’t even exist is the answer?
Price: That’s not what we’re doing.
Daisy: Sure as hell looks like it.
Price: Well, it’s not that simple.
Daisy: Just admit it. You’re afraid of people like me, afraid of our power.
Price: Absolutely. Do you even know your own strength? Could you take down this plane, for instance?
Daisy: I wouldn’t do that.
Price: But if you wanted to? You could kill me right now. Mankind’s scary enough as it is. Some psycho gets a gun, and watch out. But now people are their own weapon.
Daisy: Not everyone is like…
Price: “Some” is enough. That’s all it takes.
Daisy: You only see the terrible things.
Price: That’s not true.
Daisy: I protect people…
Price: It doesn’t matter.
Daisy: How can you say that?
Price: Because for every Daisy Johnson, there’s a Lash, and it’s ignorant for you to think otherwise.
Andrew: Melinda, talk to me. What’s all this about?
May: I need to know, for myself, before anyone else gets involved.
Andrew: Know what?
May: I saw your flight logs. I tracked your movements. You were within 30 miles of at least five Inhuman deaths.
Andrew: Why are you looking at my flight logs?
May: I pulled your medical files, too. Your blood work was deleted.
Andrew: Maybe Simmons accidentally…
May: You thought you covered your tracks, but you didn’t.
Andrew: Melinda, honestly, what are you getting at?
May: That Von Strucker kid was alive! He didn’t die in that blast. I tracked him down. He told me what you did.
Andrew: What I did? So some kid says I…
May: He wasn’t lying. The look on his face. It was pure terror. What happened to you? You can tell me.
Andrew: Melinda…
May: Don’t lie to me.
Andrew: You don’t want to know.
May: He said you were a monster.
Andrew: Melinda, don’t…
May: How could this even happen?!
Andrew: Melinda, stop.
May: Andrew, please! Please!
Andrew: Stop!
Simmons: It’s been three weeks, Fitz. If I don’t find something, if I don’t eat, I won’t make it.
Simmons: Fitz, hi. I don’t know why I’m still talking with you, why I’m recording myself. You’re never gonna see this, are you? I still haven’t found water, and it’s, um… I just… I’m having trouble focusing, and I’m trying to stay positive. But I’m scared. I’m scared, Fitz. Do you remember when we first met? I do. You were so quiet and pasty, and so incredibly smart, handsome… Quite a strange feeling, isn’t it? Never wanting to be without someone. You must have been so annoyed, me following you around all the time.
Fitz: No. Never.
Simmons: I imagine our dinner sometimes, where we’d go, what we’d eat. I wonder about us a lot, actually. There’s this small cottage in Perthshire we drove by once when I was a girl, some… some… family holiday, and I don’t know why, but I… I found it so lovely. I still think about it, a place where you and I could’ve… But that’s that, I suppose. I’m not sure how long this battery will last. I should save it, just in case, for more important things, if there’s anything. But I’ll still talk to you on my own, if that’s all right. I’ll always be with you, Fitz.
Andrew: Oh, thank god you’re awake. I am so sorry. I-I didn’t want to hurt you. I… I panicked.
May: Where are we?
Andrew: We couldn’t stay there, not with S.H.I.E.L.D. I needed time to explain. You don’t know how many times I almost told you. I just… I didn’t know how. I didn’t ask for this.
May: Oh, god. What have you done? Huh?
Andrew: Melinda, don’t. Don’t. You can’t.
May: Let me go!
Andrew: Don’t do that! I don’t… I don’t know what I’ll do. Instinct will take over again, like it did at the convenience store.
May: Instinct?
Andrew: Look, I didn’t want to hurt anyone, but I… I didn’t know what was happening.
May: You killed all those people. How? When did this… when did…
Andrew: After Hawaii. Daisy’s mom kept records. I was going through them for any insight, for research. And I found a book. It had all these names of Inhumans. Now, Jiaying must have rigged it with a Terrigen crystal to keep out anyone who couldn’t survive the mist. Lucky me. At first, I was relieved. I survived. But I knew something had happened. I felt sick and nauseous. There was this intense pulsing, like my heart was in my head. I felt different, like… like a part of me was unlocked.
May: Unlocked?
Andrew: I don’t know how else to… I just… I had to… it was as if I was compelled. I had to be near them.
May: The Inhumans.
Andrew: I didn’t know why. It was… it was intense. I had this new desire. I had a… a… had a hunger… on my skin. It wasn’t until I finally met one that my body took over, and I… I lashed out. And then I felt relief. But with you…
May: Andrew? You in there?
Andrew: You wouldn’t understand. I had to keep you away.
May: That’s why you…
Andrew: Yeah, I was a coward. I wanted to tell you, but I was worried that… you have to know. I didn’t end things with you because I don’t love you. I did it to protect you. I’m still in love with you, Melinda. And I need your help.
Coulson: Where did they go after May dismissed the security detail? Update me as you know more.
Price: Everything all right?
Coulson: Not sure yet. Could be as simple as a workplace romance gone wrong.
Price: That doesn’t sound simple.
Coulson: I think you were in the middle of telling me what great friends you and Daisy are now.
Price: I may have overstepped. But one thing’s for certain, that girl’s got fire.
Coulson: And you still haven’t told anyone about her?
Price: I keep my promises, Phil. They have no idea. New look?
Coulson: Old look, actually. It’s been a while, though.
Price: Uh, may I?
Coulson: Oh. Sure.
Price: So, you gonna tell me what really happened? 'Cause I’m not quite buying the shark-attack bit.
Coulson: You’re not buying that? One of my men cut it off. Saved my life.
Price: By chopping off your hand?
Coulson: You kind of had to be there.
Price: Does it hurt?
Coulson: Every day.
Price: Phantom pain. The thing that’s missing is the thing that you feel the most.
Coulson: Makes it hard to forget.
Price: So maybe you don’t. But it’s also important to look ahead, see what’s in front of you.
Coulson: We close to Norad?
Daisy: No. Another Quinjet’s requested to dock.
Daisy: Lincoln, what are you doing here?
Coulson: Where’d you find him?
Mack: He came to me. He’s got intel on Lash.
Lincoln: She ATCU?
Coulson: We’re working together now.
Price: Yeah, we all want to catch that thing.
Coulson: Well, Mr. Campbell, you’ve come this far. What do you have to say?
Lincoln: Those of us from Afterlife, we were trained to blend in.
Price: Afterlife?
Coulson: I’ll explain later.
Lincoln: And yet that thing keeps finding us, killed most of my friends.
Mack: Lincoln gave me names. I checked them against the bodies we could identify.
Lincoln: That’s how I knew Lash was using Jiaying’s ledger to find us.
Daisy: Her ledger?
Lincoln: She kept a genealogy of Inhumans. She was the only one allowed to use it, until…
Mack: Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it. And there’s only one person I know who had access.
Coulson: Dr. Garner? But there’s no way. It’s not possible.
Mack: I didn’t want to believe it, either.
Daisy: So you’re not just saying Andrew has the ledger. You’re saying…
Mack: I saw May access his flight logs this morning.
Daisy: I talked with her. She was upset, but I thought that she…
Coulson: She and Andrew are missing. I just got word.
Daisy: Oh, God.
Coulson: Reroute the plane. New York. Pull all the satellite footage from the Cocoon. We need to find them.
Agent: Yes, sir.
Coulson: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but the president’s gonna have to wait.
Price: Whatever you need, I’ll let them know.
Daisy: Andrew wouldn’t hurt her.
Lincoln: He’s killed dozens of us.
Daisy: Yeah, well, what if he doesn’t know what he’s doing once he turns? He blacks out or something?
Lincoln: Inhumans can’t change form. That’s not how it works.
Daisy: I saw it myself!
Lincoln: No, what I’m saying is, it’s temporary. He won’t always be able to shift between monster and man. He’s still in transition. Becoming Inhuman.
Coulson: And when that transition’s complete?
Lincoln: He’ll stay Lash, permanently. The man you think you know is disappearing, if he’s not already gone.
May: Andrew, if I hadn’t shown up, were you going to hurt Joey?
Andrew: Of course not. And you know I’d never lay a finger on Daisy.
May: But you went after Lincoln.
Andrew: That kid has a dark side. You understand more than anyone. Look at what happened in Bahrain.
May: What?
Andrew: You saw firsthand what Inhumans were capable of. If you hadn’t killed that little girl, everyone around you would’ve suffered. They all would’ve died. But you saved them.
May: This isn’t you! You would never say that.
Andrew: No, Melinda, I know exactly what I’m saying. You and me, we’re the same. That’s why I need your help.
May: I never wanted to hurt that girl.
Andrew: I know. I know, and believe me, I don’t want to do what I’m doing, either. I have to.
Andrew: I know you think I’ve lost myself. I haven’t.
May: I don’t know what to do.
Andrew: I know. Do you remember our first apartment?
May: The one on Cranbrook.
Andrew: One room, a stupid futon for a bed, and that winter when it got so cold, we…
May: We used the oven as our heater.
Andrew: Not the safest way to keep warm, but it did the trick. Melinda.
May: The world has gotten more complicated, hasn’t it?
Andrew: I know we can’t pretend it all away. But I’m still the same man you fell in love with. I never gave up on you. Please don’t give up on me.
Coulson: Sorry to interrupt. Still waiting on Joey’s reassessment.
Andrew: Phil, you don’t understand.
Coulson: I’m starting to. You all right? We’re old friends. That’s why I’d prefer to see everyone walk out of here unharmed. But in case you got something else in mind, I’m not alone.
Mack: Containment module’s secure.
Daisy: Copy that. All team’s getting into position.
Price: Remember, this is Coulson’s op. We do not move unless he gives the order. Go.
Lincoln: He’s not gonna come quietly.
Coulson: This doesn’t have to go down badly. I’ll make sure you’re taken care of.
Andrew: I understand the position you’re in, I do. And I don’t envy it. But I am trying to help you. We’ve got an outbreak on our hands.
Lincoln: What the hell does he mean by that?
Daisy: Calm down. Coulson knows what he’s doing.
Lincoln: You sure about that?
Andrew: I’m simply trying to sort the good from the bad. You gave me this job.
Coulson: That’s a pretty poor interpretation of a therapist. Look around you. We’re in some abandoned building, May’s tied up, you’re not okay.
Andrew: I know how it looks, but I have a moral responsibility! You’ll see, soon. I’m doing you a favor.
Lincoln: He’s insane.
Daisy: That’s not true. He’s just sick.
Lincoln: The beast’s gonna come out, and you can’t control it.
Mack: Don’t make things worse 'cause you got an axe to grind.
Lincoln: He’s not just gonna let us take him. He’s gonna defend himself.
Daisy: Do not engage. We move on Coulson’s order.
Andrew: I’ve only killed those who deserve it.
Lincoln: Who the hell made you judge, jury, and executioner?
Coulson: What are you doing?
May: You’ve got to get him out of here, now!
Coulson: Lincoln.
Lincoln: You tore my friends apart. You have no right!
Coulson: That’s enough.
May: Calm down, Andrew, please.
Andrew: I have every right.
Coulson: Andrew, listen to me. We can help you. The ATCU is close to a cure.
Lash: I am the cure.
Coulson: Get down.
Coulson: Lincoln and Lash are in the East wing of the building. We have to get him to the module.
Mack: On it, sir.
May: Phil…
Coulson: Our goal is to capture, not kill. We just got to get Lincoln on the same page. Try those.
Mack: Really got to commit to that shotgun-axe idea. Could use a little help here!
Daisy: What’s your twenty?
Coulson: Andrew, we’re friends. Or maybe just acquaintances.
Price: We got him.
Coulson: No!
Price: Thank you.
Coulson: Are you okay?
Price: Yeah.
Coulson: I didn’t know you could do that.
Daisy: That makes two of us.
Coulson: Where is he?
Daisy: No idea. But we got to get him to the containment module, now.
Lincoln: I’ll get him to where he needs to go.
May: Andrew, stop!
Lash: Move.
May: Go on. Might as well. I’ve thought about my death enough times, the different ways that I could go. I just never thought it’d be you. I never knew why you married me. I was never as kind and empathetic as you. That’s why it was so easy for me to walk away. Why I gave up on you. I lost something when I left you. I won’t do it again. But you have to stop this.
Andrew: Melinda.
Coulson: How’d you know that wouldn’t kill him?
May: I didn’t.
Fitz: I bloody knew it.
Morse: Fitz, you all right?
Fitz: Yeah, I think I’ve, uh… remember this?
Morse: Yeah, from the castle chamber.
Fitz: Okay.
Hunter: Oh, is that the other man? Well, I’m just gonna say what we’re all thinking, he has a hog face.
Fitz: He does have a hog face. Okay. So, look at the logo of the space program he’s with. And if you turn it upside down, they look similar, yeah?
Hunter: Bit of a stretch, mate.
Morse: Possible.
Fitz: Okay. Well, um… what if the group who carved this symbol into the chamber door is the same group that sent Will through the portal?
Morse: I thought NASA sent Will through.
Fitz: Could go beyond NASA, way beyond.
Hunter: Please don’t tell me you think some ancient order’s behind all this, 'cause that’s a bit mental even for you.
Fitz: I know how it sounds, but we’re dealing with a portal that leads to another planet, so…
Morse: Anything’s possible. It’s worth checking out, Fitz.
Mack: You gonna take Coulson up on his offer, stick around for a while?
Lincoln: Can’t run forever.
Price: If we put Andrew in stasis as a human, it’ll slow his transformation, giving us more time to find a cure. Now, I can’t pretend to understand what you’re going through, but for what it’s worth, if I had the chance to save someone I love, I’d take it.
May: What would you do?
Daisy: Well, it’s a temporary solution. I think we can all acknowledge that. But Andrew helped me. So I’d… I’d do whatever it takes.
May: Do it.
Price: Do you need to go after her?
Coulson: She wouldn’t want me to, not right now.
Price: It’s been a long day.
Coulson: Mm-hmm.
Price: Buy you a drink?
Coulson: Please.
Fitz: Hey. You okay?
Simmons: I couldn’t sleep. There aren’t a lot of windows in the base, and I wanted to…
Fitz: Watch the sunrise. I, uh… I can’t make any promises, but I think I may have found something. Might help us open up the portal.
Simmons: Really?
Fitz: And, um… fixed your SIM card, so, I heard your recordings and saw your video. Didn’t know you thought about settling down in Perthshire. That’s in Scotland.
Simmons: I know where it is, Fitz.
Fitz: So when you said all those things about… I mean, you were tired and dehydrated.
Simmons: I was as clearheaded then as I’ve ever been, when I said all those things. What do you think we should do about it?
Fitz: For now, let’s just watch the sunrise.
Andrew: What’s wrong?
May: Nothing. I never thought I deserved this.
Andrew: What, a trip to Hawaii?
May: No. Happiness. This kind of happiness.
Andrew: Of course you do. We both do.
May: Mm.
Ward: So, why am I here?
Malick: We’ll get to that. It’s a shame about Werner Von Strucker. I hope, for your sake, he doesn’t wake up.
Ward: I’m not worried. He’s weak, like his father.
Malick: Ah, careful, Mr. Ward. You paid a price for that boy. You should ask yourself if it was worth it.
Ward: You gave me his location.
Malick: I gave you what you asked for. I’m just not sure that you’re asking for the right things. Revenge only provides a temporary pleasure.
Ward: Ah. But a pleasure, nonetheless.
Malick: Ah. You should think on a grander scale.
Ward: Oh, it’ll be grand. How about I cut off the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Because without Phil Coulson, S.H.I.E.L.D. won’t grow back.
Malick: Ohh. Excuse me a moment. Ms. Price.
Price: I wanted to apologize for missing our meeting at Norad. I will bring him to you soon enough.
Malick: Time is of the essence.
Price: Oh, I better go. I’ll be in touch. You don’t have to leave so soon. How about some breakfast first?
Coulson: Are you cooking?
Price: I don’t cook. But I’m an expert at going out to eat.
Coulson: Is there anything good around here?
Price: Ruthie’s Diner is about two blocks away. She makes a mean scramble.
Coulson: I think I can make time for that.
Price: Good.
