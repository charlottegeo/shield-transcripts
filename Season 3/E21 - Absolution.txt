Coulson: How long do you think we can survive in here? We’re the last ones. You always find a way to survive, don’t you?
Daisy: It’s in our blood. I knew someone was gonna go. I just didn’t know everyone would. Once I connect the wires, I can hack the controls on the module and finally pilot us back to Earth.
Coulson: Daisy. This is Earth.
Lincoln: The kill switches to our vests, if it comes to it.
Mack: How we holding up?
May: Not sure. It wasn’t designed for this.
Daisy: I’ve told you everything I know.
Simmons: I’m here to provide progress updates based on the intel you gave us, nothing more.
Daisy: And they only send you. Why?
Simmons: If anything I tell you jogs any memories, any pertinent information at all, I’ll ask you to divulge.
Daisy: It’s because you’re the only one I didn’t hurt, personally, I mean. That’s why.
Simmons: Have you thought of any new pertinent information?
Daisy: As I said, Hive’s followers tell him everything, but he rarely returns the favor. I’m sorry that’s not enough to act on.
Simmons: Well, we are acting on a new lead. We’ve located a U.S. missile silo in the Pacific. Seems like a good fit.
Daisy: If that’s where they plan to do it, they’ll be there ahead of you.
Simmons: Yes. The silo’s staff went silent five hours ago.
Giyera: Sir, the warhead is in place, and the missile is armed.
Hive: The man who starts the launch sequence, is he willing to cooperate?
James: Yep. Turned out to be a real team player.
Hive: What about S.H.I.E.L.D.? I’ve warned you about cloaking.
Giyera: And we’ve calibrated for it. If they fly anywhere near this island, we’ll see it.
Hive: Very good.
Mack: We’re looking for the freight dock on the North side.
Daisy: Even if you infiltrate, you can’t shut down the launch, not without government kill codes.
Simmons: We are aware.
Daisy: Hand-delivered by a D.O.D. official. It’s not hackable. You won’t be…
Simmons: We are aware.
General: I’m sorry. The answer is no.
Talbot: I’m asking you for one missile launch kill code, General.
General: Violating chain of command.
Talbot: Chain of command. Chain of command’s gonna take two weeks.
General: You like to cut red tape. I get it. But procedures are in place for a reason. You’d say the same thing. I don’t even hold Kill Codes here at the D.O.D., Glenn. They’re held at the Defense Logistics Building, and I need an Arms Nullification order before I can request them from Undersecretary Thomas.
Talbot: Okay, fine. Red tape it is.
Fitz: Defense Logistics Building. Did you get that, sir?
Coulson: Copy that. The team’s just got to secure that uplink in time.
Mack: All right, here. This is us. Now, look, none of this works unless you…
Lincoln: We’ll get the uplink. Coulson’s just got to get those codes in time.
Mack: Okay.
Talbot: You sure this is gonna work?
Fitz: Nope. Ahh. Ahh! Many men on the Moon. Aaah. Aaah. Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!
Talbot: Stop it. Andaz is an inch taller than I am.
Talbot: Undersecretary Thomas, thank you for getting back to us so quickly.
Thomas: General Talbot. General Andaz.
Fitz: Yes, Undersecretary Thomas. I have an Arms Nullification order, and I need you to provide the Kill Codes for…
Thomas: The code must be provided in person.
Talbot: I have a high-level ATCU agent waiting outside right now.
Fitz: He’s acting under my authority.
Thomas: I’ll need his credentials.
Fitz: Oh, he has them. You bet.
Thomas: Okay.
Giyera: Launch sequence has begun, sir.
Coulson: Undersecretary Thomas?
Thomas: Very good.
May: We’re in. Uplink’s established. Daisy’s intel panned out.
Lincoln: We got security feeds, too.
May: Yeah, bonus. Every time I see his face, I want to punch something.
Fitz: They’ve got us the uplink. Ready, sir. Did you get it? Read it out to me.
Coulson: Okay. It’s… Oh.
Fitz: We are at 20 seconds. Give me the code, sir.
Coulson: Okay, try to keep up. Bravo-5-Hotel-NinerMike-1-Charlie-1. 3-4-2-0-0-Niner. Sierra-Tango-1-3-5. Sierra-Whiskey-0-1-2-0…
May: Come on. Come on.
Simmons: The only thing you gave us that didn’t pan out was that word. You said he mentioned “absolution.” Any idea what he meant?
Daisy: He thinks he’s the savior.
Giyera: Someone shut us down. That can only be done within the building.
Hive: S.H.I.E.L.D. Again. Fix this. Bypass this override!
Radcliffe: Me? W-What… What can I do? I’m not a-a flight systems engineer.
Hive: No, you’re not. So the only thing that’s left to decide is whether to add your mind to my current collection or just consume your flesh.
Radcliffe: No, I-I can handle it. I’ll fix it, I swear. Please, don’t do those things.
Hive: You two, escort Dr. Radcliffe to the missile silo while I show S.H.I.E.L.D. something they haven’t seen from me yet. Rage.
Hive: Start searching on the main floor and work your way down. Any S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents you find, bring them to me.
Lincoln: Well, Fitz came through. That’s good, right?
May: Well, we have pissed-off Inhumans and a pissed-off Hive, so good and bad.
Lincoln: But, I mean, at least Lash… at least Andrew didn’t die in vain. The information Daisy brought back has been useful.
May: You’re trying to make us feel better. Find meaning in Andrew’s death or what Daisy’s done.
Lincoln: Maybe.
May: Don’t do that.
Lincoln: They know where we are.
May: I need to move fast, make my way up to the silo and secure the warhead.
Lincoln: Good luck.
May: You, too.
Mack: Okay. Let’s see…
Elena: Your work, it’s too slow.
Mack: Well, I’m sorry we all don’t have superspeed.
Elena: Oh, this isn’t about superspeed. This is about your turtle speed. You work and then you stare and work and then more staring. We have to go.
Mack: Hurtful.
Elena: Finish. We have to get the hostages.
Mack: Well, if this doesn’t work, the hostages won’t matter. Neither will we. ‘Cause if Hive gets through here, we’re all dead or worse.
Elena: Would you really use these? Good. Because I’d rather die than be anyone’s slave.
Mack: I don’t even know why you’re on this damned mission. It’s too dangerous. That’s why you should have this.
Elena: What do you think you’re doing?
Mack: I’m giving you your cross back. You need it more than I do.
Elena: This isn’t a lucky rabbit’s foot. This is a symbol of faith. Who would return such a gift? Now hurry. We’re running out of time.
Coulson: You walked Mack through the assembly?
Fitz: Yep, more times than I can count and gave him written directions. And I think it’s out of our hands now. Taking down Hive’s up to the field team.
Coulson: They’re not just fighting Hive. There’s a legion of memories inside him. They’re up against every soldier, every genius, every killer he’s ever been. That’s a lot of people to outsmart.
Simmons: Daisy’s awake.
Coulson: Did she have any more information? Did she remember what “absolution” means?
Simmons: I don’t think she knows.
Fitz: Maybe it’s buried too deep.
Coulson: We have to keep digging.
Radcliffe: All right. We don’t have much time, so let’s just jump right in. Obviously, someone has fed a code into the facility’s network, thereby disabling the system. All I have to do is bypass it altogether and manually launch the missile. However, that situation would require a rocket scientist or an engineer, and I am neither. Therefore, we’re gonna have to put our heads together and sort this out. I’m gonna call you Ronald and you… Ronald Two. Now, as I’m sure you were both productive, intelligent members of society before you became you. So, tell me, have either of you retained any… any knowledge from your past, any computer skills, engineering, or mechanics? I don’t know if you remember what begging is, but this is exactly that, so please give me something, because I don’t have the tools to… All right. This is progress. Just keep pushing on.
Hive: I know you’re in here, Lincoln. It’s useless to hide. I think it’s time we had a heart-to-heart, don’t you? Sorry for taking Daisy from you. Oh, I know that hurt. She told me it would.
Coulson: Fitz entered the kill code in time. That’s step one.
Daisy: And Hive?
Coulson: That’s step two.
Daisy: Thank you for the update.
Coulson: I know you’re doing everything you can to try to jog your memory, but when he said absolution…
Daisy: I told her everything I know. Just like I told him.
Coulson: Once we get an update, so will you. You’re a prisoner right now, but that’s temporary. You have to understand this… this is a new situation.
Daisy: I understand.
Coulson: The security protocols are in place to keep everyone safe.
Daisy: I get it!
Coulson: No one blames you for this.
Daisy: Then that’s on you, because I deserve the blame, all of it. And these protocols? Make them permanent, because I belong in this box.
Coulson: You’re not a criminal.
Daisy: That’s exactly what I am. So you can keep your forgiveness and your pity because I shouldn’t have either, or your friendship.
Coulson: Daisy, you were brainwashed.
Daisy: So was Ward. We make the perfect pair.
Hive: Daisy loved you. At least, she thought she did. You deserve to know that. You have to understand, Lincoln, I gave her something you never could. Happiness. True happiness comes from belonging. That’s something she needs that you could never offer her. Now, deep down, you know this. I made Daisy whole and I can do the same for you. We can walk out of this room, find her together.
Lincoln: You’re never gonna see Daisy again.
Hive: Oh, go ahead. Destroy this body. It’s well-worn. I’ll just go in someone else. Maybe someone in S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson: Hive didn’t just get in your head. He changed it on a fundamental level. He altered the chemistry of your brain like a drug. These are the aftereffects. You’re going through withdrawal right now.
Daisy: Is that all you think this is? That I’m dope sick?
Coulson: You’re not gonna feel like this forever.
Daisy: I want to. I want to feel this pain until I find Hive.
Coulson: And get revenge? I can’t imagine what you’ve been through, but that craving? I know something about that. You think vengeance is the missing piece of the puzzle, that it will make you whole again, but all it does is break you further. You’re going to get better. It just takes time and distance.
Daisy: No. I should wake up every morning and feel like this, remembering every drop of blood I spilled. Do you still have the memory machine? You used it on that Strucker kid.
Coulson: Daisy, stop.
Daisy: Put me in it. I bet you’re already thinking about doing that, right, to jog my memory. So bring it in here. Make it my bed and keep every memory, every detail right at the surface, where it belongs.
Coulson: That’s enough. We pulled the memory machine out of storage, but it’s not for you.
Lincoln: Is it ready yet? Tell me it’s ready!
Mack: I need more time. Go. You guys, go on. Get back! Run! I don’t want to have to use this.
Elena: You don’t need this.
Mack: How did you…
Elena: I watch you work slow. I move faster. Your turn.
Hive: Aah!
Simmons: Will!
Simmons: If I ever see you again, I’ll kill you.
Hive: This won’t kill me!
Mack: No. But it’ll suck.
Hive: Aaah!
Elena: Does this mean the plan worked?
Mack: It’s doing something.
Lincoln: The hostages.
Elena: I know.
Young Gideon: Closure.
Young Nathaniel: I thought we had a deal.
Fitz: I know that you care about us, Ward!
Gideon: I’m asking you to lead.
Lincoln: I can’t hold this much longer. You think we’ve done it? Fried his brain?
Mack: Let’s not wait around and find out.
Ward: Do you believe I’m telling you the truth?
Hive: Do you believe I’m telling you the truth?
Giyera: Yes. Of course we believe you.
Hive: You have to go.
James: Okay. Okay.
Simmons: Will!
Hive: Jemma. Jemma!
Will: Jemma, run! go!
Hive: Run! Run!
James: Do you think the boss has gone a little gonzo maybe?
Hive: Together to the end.
Young Gideon: Together to the end.
Young Nathaniel: Together to the end.
Hive: Together to the end. We have a connection… a connection. I want a connection. Aaah!
Radcliffe: Well, at least you bring strength to the table. That’s never been my forte. Right, listen up. This is called a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. Grunt along with me. Unified…
May: On the ground, now! What the hell did you do to them?
Radcliffe: Well, it’s not my finest work, but I was under extreme duress.
May: I want that warhead.
Elena: I’m here.
Mack: Good. You got to hurry.
Elena: Oh, turtle-man wishes for me to hurry. (in Spanish) He’s very lucky he is handsome.
Elena: Follow me. Come on!
Hive: There are things about me, you wouldn’t like me if you knew.
Ward: You wouldn’t like me if you knew.
Hive: …wouldn’t like me if you knew.
Giyera: Sir? Focus. Let us help you.
Hive: I am not a good man, Skye. He wanted a connection, a connection with her. You can’t ever get attached to anyone. To anyone or anything. You have to fight that weakness in you. Fight that weakness! You have to fight that weakness inside of you.
James: Dude, what the actual hell?
Hive: I need a connection. I want a connection. I want a connection. A connection. To connect, we have to disconnect. We need to disconnect it.
James: Disconnect what?
Hive: Disconnect the warhead for absolution.
James: So, you got that? Do you want to fill a brother in?
Hive: I just wanted to save you. Save you. I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out…
Ward: … find a way out… to find a way out, like you always do
Hive: … always do. Like you did. You want me to cross them off?
Radcliffe: Did S.H.I.E.L.D. send you? Did they?
May: Yes. I’m with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Radcliffe: Oh, thank God. Take me with you. You have to, please! Oh, no.
May: Giyera.
Radcliffe: He’s taking the warhead.
May: Damn! We have to move! Come on!
Mack: Let’s go, people! Move, move! We need to get away from this place now! Go!
Lincoln: She did good. Look at all these people.
Elena: Yeah, good thing we brought the very small plane to carry them.
Mack: We’ll have room.
May: We’re adding another one! Come on. Come on.
Hive: Wait! What did you do to me?
Lincoln: The only thing we could think of.
Mack: Did we just…
May: Yeah, we did.
Lincoln: We caught Hive.
Radcliffe: Yes! Whoo!
Daisy: Is everything okay? What’s going on?!
Talbot: The hostages are free. We got Hive. Finally, some success. I have to admit, your sending Inhumans in after him I thought that was a stupid gamble. Seriously stupid. Like “betting on WrestleMania” stupid. But you were right. You knew what you were doing. Congratulations, Coulson.
Coulson: The mission isn’t a success yet. The warhead’s still in play, laced with a pathogen that could alter humanity as we know it.
Talbot: I’m well aware of what it’s capable of doing. I’ve got a crew running clean-up at the facility right now. I think they’ve rounded up a few of those freaks already.
Coulson: I think you mean “victims.”
Talbot: Look, I don’t want one more soul on this planet to end up looking like that. We need to reverse what that monster’s done, and you got to find somebody to help us figure out how.
May: Start with him. He’s the one that turned those people into Inhu…
Radcliffe: Primitives. Primitives. I call them Primitives. Radcliffe. Dr. Holden Radcliffe. And I really can’t apologize enough for what’s happened to those people.
Coulson: No. You really can’t.
Radcliffe: But I’m also a victim here. I was forced to develop that formula.
Talbot: You better do right by those people.
Radcliffe: I can tell by your mustache that you’re a man of importance and not to be trifled with, so I will be absolutely honest with you. The process is irreversible.
Talbot: And I can tell by your beady little eyes that you’re a worm. So let me be absolutely honest with you. If you don’t find a solution to this problem, you’re gonna end up looking like one of those mouth-breathers you made. You understand?
Radcliffe: How could I not? Almost as scary as Hive, that one.
Simmons: Remember us?
Coulson: Fitz and Simmons are working with Dr. Radcliffe on a way to counter the effects of Hive’s formula, but that’s a long shot. The threat has to be neutralized before it comes close to detonating. We need to find Hive’s base of operations and get the jump on his people.
Mack: They might make our search easier for us. As long as we have Hive, they’re gonna come for him.
Coulson: We’ll be ready. I want everyone on high alert and the base sealed off. That includes the hangar door.
Mack: Yeah, parts for its hydraulics finally came in. Already got a team on it.
Lincoln: What can I do, sir?
Coulson: You’ve done enough. Mack filled me in on your performance. Well done.
Lincoln: I just want this to be over.
Coulson: Remember, I told you I decide if you get to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.? I think you’d make a great agent.
Lincoln: You also said that I had to want it. I don’t think that I do. You got a lot of good people on this team. Real heroes. That’s not me. Once we’re done with Hive, I’m done with all of it, I think.
Mack: Just like that? Wha… I mean, what are you gonna do?
Lincoln: I don’t know, Mack. Trying to figure that out. See the world.
Coulson: I think that’s a mistake, Lincoln. You have a future here at S.H.I.E.L.D. What about Daisy?
Lincoln: There’s nothing I have to offer Daisy that she wants or needs. I know that now.
Mack: Is anyone gonna talk to her, at least let her know we have Hive?
Coulson: That’s not a great idea right now. We need to stick to the security protocols.
Mack: You got to be kidding me.
Lincoln: Should we stop him?
Coulson: I don’t think we can.
Mack: We got him.
Daisy: Hive.
Mack: Mhm. Safe, sound, and catatonic in a Gel-Matrix chamber. I thought you’d want to know.
Daisy: Thanks. But you should be in the module. The protocols are for your own safety.
Mack: You think I give a damn about security protocols? You’re my partner.
Daisy: We’re not partners anymore. So just leave. You remember what happened last time.
Mack: Yeah. And I forgive you.
Daisy: I didn’t ask for that.
Mack: That’s too bad. I forgive you.
Daisy: No, don’t be stupid. Get away, okay? No, just get… get…
Mack: It’s okay, Daisy. It’s okay.
Daisy: Get away. Get… Get… Get away!
Mack: Daisy, it’s okay.
Daisy: No! Mnh! I don’t deserve this.
Fitz: I’ve only scratched the surface of the thumb drive that Radcliffe gave us, and I can already see that he was in way over his head. His enhancements rely on technology. These changes are pure bio. The Parasite in his formula actually attaches itself to strands of DNA.
Simmons: We’ll find a cure.
Fitz: Possibly, in a decade or so. What are you working on?
Simmons: Oh, nothing. Just browsing some… things.
Fitz: You’re a terrible liar.
Simmons: Well, it was supposed to be a surprise.
Fitz: Booking a trip?
Simmons: For two.
Fitz: That’s a romantic gesture. How very… not you… to be romantic.
Simmons: What? Of cou… That is ridiculous.
Fitz: We both know that I’m the romantic one. But it might not be the best time to be skipping off to the… Seychelles? Does look nice.
Simmons: Hive’s in custody, S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to recover that warhead, and then I was thinking that… We’ve had enough tragedy. A little fun wouldn’t kill us. You think I’m not romantic? I’m gonna do something with you on that island that will take your breath away.
Fitz: What is… Are you? Are you? Are you? Wha?
Simmons: Snorkeling. Did you know there are over 1,000 species of fish in the Seychelles? I cannot wait. Everything all right?
Fitz: Yeah. I need to go inspect the Gel-Matrix chamber and sign off before they can bring Hive into the base. Is this yours?
Simmons: No. I think it’s Yo-Yo’s.
Fitz: All right. I’ll give it to her.
Daisy: You’re a man of faith.
Mack: You know I am.
Daisy: So what was it like, coming face-to-face with the devil?
Mack: Hive? Well, he’s evil, scary as all hell, but I don’t think he’s the devil.
Daisy: You don’t get it. When Hive takes over a body, he steals that person’s memories. That’s as close to stealing a soul as you can get.
Mack: “Memory is the scribe of the soul.”
Daisy: The Bible?
Mack: Aristotle. What? I have dimensions. Look, Tremors, I’ve had my mind controlled.
Daisy: No, this wasn’t that. The worst part about Hive is, when he’s making you hurt the people you care about, he makes you love him for it. If Hive isn’t the devil, he’s the closest thing to it you and I will ever see. It’s not safe. If he got out, he…
Mack: He’s not getting out.
Daisy: He can’t be contained. He has to be destroyed.
Mack: You know another thing the devil is capable of? Filling a person with so much anger and so many dark thoughts that it consumes them. But it’s up to that individual to make a choice either let the darkness fester and grow or let the light inside shine through and vanquish the darkness.
Daisy: This isn’t about revenge.
Mack: Hey. We’re safe. Coulson’s sealing up the base.
Fitz: Gel’s stable. Power’s strong enough for transport. Um, make sure you reconnect that once it’s inside and secure.
O'Brien: You got it.
Fitz: When’s the bloody hangar door gonna get closed, O'Brien?
O'Brien: We’ve got engineers on it. We had to wait a few days. Parts were delayed.
Fitz: O'Brien! Wait!
Simmons: What is it? What’s happening?
Coulson: Jemma, there was an explosion in the hangar.
Simmons: Fitz. Okay. What do we do?
Agent: Let’s get out of here! Aah!
Fitz: No! No, no, no, no! The lockdown. Hey! Hey, help!
May: They’re trapped inside.
Lincoln: Can we override the doors?
Coulson: We put everything on lockdown. By the time we override, Fitz will be… Fitz, do you read?
Fitz: Yeah! Sir, I’m in a bit of trouble!
Coulson: We know. We’re gonna get you out of there.
Fitz: No, no, no, no! Stay away from them! Stay away from the gas! We have to get out of the hangar!
Agent: Come on.
Fitz: No, no, no. There’s nothing you can do for them. We have to get back out to the base.
Fitz: Hey! How are you doing in there?!
Simmons: Fitz, it’s the lockdown. We can’t…
Fitz: The motion sensors! You have to get them working again.
Coulson: If we isolate them from the system, can we get around the lockdown?
Fitz: Yes! You can fry the bridging, which connects the sensor system to the security protocol!
Lincoln: I can do that.
Simmons: No, the server system is on the other side of the base. It won’t work.
May: Well, we need to do something fast.
Simmons: Fitz, Professor Vaughn’s Third Year Compiler Theory?
Fitz: Yeah! Yeah! Do that! Fast, please!
Simmons: I’m not an engineer. I hope I can recreate what you did there.
Fitz: No, no, no! You saw me do it! You have a good memory! I mean, you do, right?
Fitz: Hey, it’s open! It’s open!
Fitz: Thank you, Jemma.
Coulson: What the hell is Professor Vaughn’s Third Year Compiler Theory?
Simmons: It’s complicated.
Coulson: Well, that’s not good.
Lincoln: If Hive gets out of stasis…
May: It’s not an “if.”
Coulson: No. It’s not. At least we sealed off the hangar.
Elena: But there are S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel in there.
Coulson: They’re gone. We have to cut our losses. It’s all we can do.
Daisy: I can’t believe this is happening.
Mack: He wants a way out.
Daisy: No.
Mack: What? Daisy, what is it?
Daisy: I told him everything.
Mack: Yeah, we know that, but what does that have to do…
Daisy: No, Mack, I told him everything, including the plans to the Zephyr.
Mack: And the fact that it has high-altitude capabilities.
Daisy: Hive has his delivery system now.
Lincoln: Daisy.
Mack: She’s safe in her cell.
Coulson: Which is where you two should be.
Lincoln: Not a chance.
Elena: You can put the vests on us, but we fight.
Mack: We don’t have time for this! Daisy said Hive knows everything the Zephyr’s capable of. If he gets his hands on it…
May: That’s his new missile.
Coulson: And we brought him right to it.
Mack: He still looks shaky. Maybe he won’t remember how to fly it.
May: That’s a thin hope to hang onto.
Coulson: We can’t let Hive get control of that ship.
May: We need to get someone in there.
Coulson: I can’t ask anyone to do that.
Elena: I can go in. The gas won’t change me.
Coulson: No, but it can sway you. I won’t let what happened to Daisy happen to anyone else.
Hive: Take a breath. You don’t need to think of the whole solution. Just… Just part of it. Right? Pieces solving a puzzle.
Daisy: Hey.
Hive: Sorry. Having trouble. My memories. You were in that one.
Daisy: Do you have any idea what you did to me?
Hive: Yes. I remember. You’re in pain.
Daisy: Please… take me back.
