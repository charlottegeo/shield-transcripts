Man: Agent May? He’s alive.
Woman: Possible pneumo on the right. Let’s get him on the monitor.
Man: He’s dry. I’m starting him on another liter of fluid.
May: Andrew, what happened?
Andrew: I went into the store. I… I had a headache. I needed something. One of my students was there. Was, uh…
Strucker: Hey, professor.  Where you been?
Andrew: Transfer student. He only started a few weeks ago. Had two men with him. You know, my experience is limited, but I’d say they were professionals.
Coulson: It was HYDRA.
Andrew: Don’t know why they’d be after me.
May: I do.
Coulson: May, this isn’t your fault.
May: How’d you survive?
Andrew: Phil. He had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tailing me. The man saved my life. He gave me time to find cover, and he must’ve caught Alex off guard because nothing went exactly as planned. The kid had a lighter. I barely made it to the door. The blast must’ve thrown me clear. The next thing I remember, you were there, picking me up. I’m lucky. Can’t see how anyone would’ve survived that. Now, I know Alex is trouble, but I’m not sorry he’s gone. Ward would’ve made him finish the job. What if Ward…
May: He won’t.
Coulson: You’re safe now. We got you. We’ll let the doctor work on you. You need to get some rest.
May: Where the hell do you think you’re going?
Hunter: Uh, I think I’m going to see Andrew.
May: No.
Hunter: I just want to make sure he’s all right.
May: You’re the reason he’s not.
Hunter: Ward was gonna hurt him no mat… I made the most logical choice.
May: Logical? You wanted revenge.
Coulson: Hey, hey, hey!
Hunter: Coulson’s orders were to end him. I had one shot. I took it.
Coulson: And you missed. You’re off that assignment.
May: Good. Then put me on it. Let me go after him.
Coulson: Are you back?
May: Yeah, I’m back.
Ward: S.H.I.E.L.D. sent a man to assassinate me. He came into my house and tried to kill me. ‘Cause you let him in. You were sloppy.
Kebo: I followed your protocol. He killed a man to get close to you. He wanted you dead that much.
Ward: They all want me dead that much! Now we have a dangling thread.
Kebo: Von Strucker. You shouldn’t have sent a boy to do a man’s job.
Ward: Not really sure you’d have blended in as an undergrad watching Garner. Has Von Strucker called in? So, he’s either captured, killed, or he’s running.
Kebo: And only one of those options works for us. The kid knows too much.
Ward: So go and find him before S.H.I.E.L.D. does. And if he’s still alive, take care of him.
Coulson: Hey. How you holding up?
Daisy: I’m pissed. I got manhandled by Lash, and it messed up our chance to see the ATCU facility. But, good news, I have a theory.
Coulson: I like theories.
Daisy: Lash was tracking us. He knew where our truck was. He… He needed inside info for that.
Coulson: You think he’s got access to ATCU information?
Daisy: No, I… I think he’s in the ATCU. We know that he can transform himself into a regular-sized guy and back. What if he’s hiding out as one of them?
Coulson: That’s a scary thought. I’ve got Rosalind giving me a tour of her operation today. Let me see what I find there.
Daisy: Good. I’ll see what I can get on Lash’s identity.
Coulson: And whatever you dig into, try to keep it off Rosalind’s radar. I need her to trust me today.
Daisy: You’re not having a hard time working her, are you? Not getting too attached?
Coulson: You do this long enough, you learn to cut yourself off from all that. Makes it easier to do the job.
Daisy: Sir? Is May really back for good?
Coulson: I’m not sure. Right now, she’s out for blood.
Morse: May, I heard about Andrew. How’s he… Hey! What the hell?!
May: Hunter nearly cost Andrew his life, and he was doing it for you.
Morse: I-I feel terrible.
May: You were egging him on, letting him fight your battles for you! It’s your fault!
Morse: If I knew Andrew was in danger, I never… Ohh! Okay. You’re upset.
May: So, you can fight your own battles.
Morse: What? You were testing me?
May: Had to make sure you were mission-ready.
Morse: Coulson still has me off combat duty. The tests say that my lung isn’t healed all the way yet.
May: My test says otherwise. Wheels up in 20. Welcome back, Agent Morse.
Hunter: Bob.
May: Not your mission, Hunter. Stay away, or I’ll make you stay away.
Hunter: I just want a minute with my ex-wife.
Hunter: I’m going with you.
Morse: Like hell you are. You put Andrew at risk.
Hunter: I had Ward in my sights. Damn right I pulled the trigger. You of all people should get it.
Morse: I get it. You were quick to violence, and an innocent got hurt. Other people aren’t as used to your behavior as I am.
Hunter: Since when do you care what other people think? You’re really going back in the field? After him?
Morse: I’m ready.
Hunter: You lying?
Morse: No.
Hunter: Do better than I did, yeah?
Morse: You’re not gonna say the thing?
Hunter: You already know.
May: Andrew didn’t get all the details exactly right. He said there were four men on the scene, but only three bodies were recovered. Coulson’s man, two HYDRA guys. The fourth guy was one of Andrew’s students. That’s his I.D., but it’s an alias. He’s not Alexander Braun. He’s Werner Von Strucker.
Morse: Wait. Von Strucker? As in…
May: Hail HYDRA.
Morse: Ward was starting his own little HYDRA dynasty. Cute.
May: We find the Strucker kid, he’ll lead us back to Ward.
Morse: You got a how?
May: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s been monitoring several Hydra bank accounts for a while now. One just woke up. Cayman Islands.
Morse: Well, Strucker needed funds. Makes sense. What’s the op?
May: How’s your Mandarin?
Morse (in Mandarin): You tell me.
May: If we head down there, maybe we’ll pick up his trail. He’s on the run from Ward, from us. Almost makes me feel sorry for the kid.
Strucker: He’s a monster.
Malick: You were right to ask me to come.
Strucker: I didn’t know where else to turn. I figured you and my father must’ve dealt with guys like Ward all the time. Ward is… I didn’t finish the mission. He won’t care why.
Malick: If you put an untested youth in play without proper training, it’s foolish. Boggles the mind, really. Your father understood protecting assets was more important than flaunting them.
Strucker: He never let me in on that stuff. You were nicer to me than he was.
Malick: Your father was a great man. Trust me. We would’ve never put up with such things.
Strucker: You don’t know this guy Ward. He’s scary.
Malick: I’m aware of Grant Ward. He was once an untested youth, too. Everyone has a history.
Strucker: So does that mean you’ll help me?
Malick: I’ll handle everything.
Coulson: Nice of you to pick me up.
Price: Yes. On the corner, since you won’t tell me where your base is.
Coulson: You know I run a spy organization, right?
Price: And you know we agreed to share information, right? Yeah? When? Do you know who? All right, just have them get started. I’m on my way. Turn around. We need to head back.
Driver: Yes, madam.
Price: I’m sorry. It’s an emergency I need to handle. We’ll reschedule. So, this is the part where you get out of the car.
Coulson: I don’t think so.
Price: Do you not get how this works?
Coulson: What I get is that it’s time to see this facility. No more delays. I’ll stay with you. When the emergency’s done, then we can go.
Price: You can’t. Not where I’m going.
Coulson: Oh. So we’re not sharing information, then? ‘Cause you kind of just made a whole thing about that.
Price: Okay. Director Coulson will be joining us. Take me home.
Hunter: I just thought you could use some help.
Fitz: I’ve got it. I promise. I just need to concentrate.
Hunter: Really? 'Cause it looks like your mind’s kind of elsewhere.
Fitz: The portal simulation is just running in the background. They’re not taking any of my time.
Hunter: Doesn’t make it a good idea.
Fitz: What? You don’t think I should help Simmons rescue Will?
Hunter: Do you think you should? He’s the competition. If your girlfriend’s ex wants to visit from Phoenix, you do not buy him a plane ticket.
Fitz: That’s really specific.
Hunter: Huh?
Fitz: Anyway, this guy kept Simmons alive. I owe him. He deserves my help.
Hunter: Just because he kept Simmons warm for a few months, with fire, doesn’t mean he’s someone you should save. How much do you even know about him?
Fitz: What’re you doing? In here, I mean. Why are you here?
Hunter: Coulson put me on the bench. So I thought I would offer my expertise elsewhere. Is that what you’re going with, “Katelin Frayer?” Is that how you spell “Katelin”? K-a-t…? I’m not sure that’s right, mate.
Fitz: Yeah, no, th… there’s lots of ways to spell “Katelin.” And can you please just find somewhere else to make yourself useful?
Hunter: Copy that.
Daisy: Dr. Garner, it’s good to see you up. Do you have time for a consult?
Andrew: Oh, god, yes, please. Came off more desperate than I intended. Being laid up is very boring. What’s up?
Daisy: It’s Lash.
Andrew: Lash?
Daisy: The Inhuman killer monster.
Andrew: Oh, right. I heard you had a run-in with him. Glad you’re okay.
Daisy: That is what I don’t understand. Why am I okay? He kills Inhumans. He killed Frye. Why spare me?
Andrew: That’s a tough one. Still trying to put together an Inhuman psych profile. And you know, they’re all different.
Daisy: Yeah, but he’s really different. He changed into a guy, a regular guy.
Andrew: You saw him? Did you get a good look at him?
Daisy: No, just a shadow, but still.
Andrew: I didn’t know that was possible.
Daisy: Me neither, but someone that big and ugly. I mean, it makes sense. He’s got to get around without being noticed somehow.
Andrew: Maybe Lincoln can help. You know where he is?
Daisy: No idea. He’s been off the grid since the ATCU tried picking him up, but he calls sometimes.
Mack: Hey, tremors, you got a sec?
Daisy: Yeah. Um… Thank you. I’ll keep you posted.
Daisy: What’s up?
Mack: Been thinking about your ATCU theory. Now, who took off before the convoy left, and who knew the exact route we were going to take?
Daisy: Banks.
Mack: He’s got access to everything that ATCU learns about Inhumans.
Daisy: We should tail him.
Mack: Already got a van ready to go, full surveillance package. Infrared scanners, one-way glass.
Daisy: Perfect. Let me get some things.
Hunter: I’ll drive. I mean, please.
Morse: Ms. Wong would like to access her safe-deposit box. Here’s her account number.
Deschamps: I will need your I.D.s, please.
Morse: Of course. (in Mandarin) Let’s hope Fitz got these right.
May (in Mandarin): Your batons ready?
Morse: Ms. Wong likes your tie.
Deschamps: Follow me.
May (in Mandarin): Here we go.
Deschamps: Take as much time as you need.
May: Box 38.
Morse: Fitz, we need anything on Strucker, anything that will get us to Ward.
Fitz: Yeah, getting it. Real-estate deeds, passport. No cash?
Morse: He must’ve cleared it all out. He…
Fitz: Oh, uh, guys, I think you triggered an alarm somewhere.
May: Great.
Morse: How much time do we have?
Fitz: Uh… Oh. Looks like zero.
May (in Mandarin): We’re screwed.
Deschamps: What is happening in here?
May (in Mandarin): I’ll take out the one on the left. You go for the one on the right. Manager won’t be an issue.
Morse: My boss would like to congratulate you.
Deschamps: What?
May (in Mandarin): What?
Morse: Your security system is top-notch, and your team is incredibly efficient. Just what we’d hoped for.
May (in Mandarin): You must be kidding me…
Morse: We’ve been reading up on you.
Fitz: Oh, I see where you’re going with this. One second.
Morse: We’d like to offer you a job.
Deschamps: A job? This seems most unorthodox.
Morse: We were sent from your former employer, First Fiduciary National, and they would like you back. I know it’s been hard, your wife missing Miami. How long have you been separated?
Deschamps: You know about that?
May (in Mandarin): Seriously, this is not a good idea.
Morse: You’re only earning 4% more than you were in 2012. We can do better.
May (in Mandarin): That’s just mean.
Deschamps: I… I have been looking to make a change.
Morse (in Mandarin): See? Diplomacy works.
May (in Mandarin): Not for this guy. Now we do it my way.
May: Sorry.
Hunter: No one yet. Banks still not back.
Mack: He wasn’t back 37 seconds ago, either, but thanks for the regular updates.
Daisy: This guy is bad news. Got discharged from the marines.
Mack: With cause.
Daisy: And Rosalind hired him anyway.
Mack: He was part of an elite anti-alien task force after New York.
Daisy: Of course he was.
Hunter: So what’s the plan when he gets back? Is this a grab-and-torture kind of deal? Chokehold might not work if he turns out to be Lash. But we could…
Daisy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, gitmo. I thought you just wanted to drive.
Hunter: Just offering helpful suggestions.
Mack: Helpful in what way, exactly?
Hunter: Um… stopping bad guys?
Mack: How about professionalism? Doing your job smart, not getting people killed?
Hunter: Hmm. Wild guess, this isn’t about following Banks.
Daisy: Hunter, come on. Andrew almost died.
Hunter: And there we have it. Look, it’s not like I just handed over Andrew and said, “hey, please kill our friend.”
Mack: Right. “I had no choice.”
Hunter: I had no choice. I…
Daisy: Guys, guys.
Mack: Looks like we’re following him home. At a safe distance!
Price: Rosalind price, ATCU.
Officer: Yes, ma'am. Sorry about the circumstances. We’ll do our best to make sure we find whoever broke in here.
Coulson: Someone broke into your home?
Price: Any leads?
Officer: Not yet. Looks like the guy was scared away by your, uh… very impressive security system. All right if we take a look around?
Price: Of course. Not you. This way.
Coulson: Nice place, huh? Can tell a lot about a woman from her books. Okay, I didn’t actually know that there were this many biographies of Margaret Thatcher. New furniture. Brand new. Holy… Where did you get…
Price: Don’t touch my things.
Coulson: Sorry. Anything missing?
Price: You weren’t listening in when I talked to the cop? You’re slipping, Phil. I thought you’d definitely be scoping things out.
Hunter: He’s gonna go back inside when he finishes his call.
Mack: What’s our next move? He goes in his house, we’re done for the day.
Daisy: I don’t want to give up on him yet.
Mack: I could break into his car, drop a spot cam in his speedometer.
Daisy: We have to be stealthy. If he catches you, we’re toast. Coulson is in the belly of the beast. We can’t tip off the ATCU that we’re on to them.
Mack: There must be some way we can keep…
Daisy: What…
Mack: Oh, no.
Daisy: What’s happening?
Banks: Hey!
Daisy: Come on!
Mack: Oh!
Mack: So much for stealthy.
Hunter: Here we go.
Mack: And this is a good idea how?
Hunter: I didn’t kill him, I-I just iced him.
Daisy: And screwed Coulson. He’s working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two. When she finds out…
Hunter: She won’t. That’s what the bandana’s for. Lash is an Inhuman. Inhumans have markers in their DNA. If we test Banks’ blood for markers, we’ll know if he’s Inhuman or not.
Daisy: That’s actually kind of smart.
Hunter: Thank you.
Daisy: But I still think you need to talk about your anger issues.
Mack: And this isn’t the med lab. We don’t have the equipment to draw banks’ blood.
Mack: Oh.
Daisy: Okay.
Hunter: There you go, blood. Okay, there might be a small anger issue.
Daisy: Just pass me the swab.
Simmons: All I’m saying is that you’ve been through something extreme. There will be after-effects. Sound familiar?
Andrew: It’s eye-opening, being on this side of the counseling. People treat you with kid gloves. They mean well, but the more they try to help…
Simmons: The weaker you feel.
Andrew: Maybe it’s our PHDs. Makes them underestimate just how strong we really are.
Simmons: Might just be. Excuse me. Daisy?
Daisy: Jemma, I know you haven’t been in the lab and I hate to ask you to do work, but if…
Simmons: In fact, I can handle it, actually. Whatever it is.
Daisy: Do you have time to run a blood analysis? I want to see if Banks has Inhuman markers.
Simmons: I have plenty of time. Send away.
Daisy: Thank you, Jemma.
Simmons: I’ll call when I know.
Daisy: Okay. Anything?
Mack: Guy shops at Costco.
Daisy: Anything useful?
Hunter: There’s not even any selfies. Banks, you are boring. Well, apart from the fact that he might be a giant beast who blows holes in people’s chests, but… I-I-I didn’t do it. I-It wasn’t me. I…
Mack: We know. It’s a phone. “Subject en route to Endotex.” No caller I.D.
Daisy: Something called Endotex Labs in Gaithersburg? We could check it out. What do you think?
Mack: Well, we’ve got time before Simmons comes back with results.
Hunter: What about him?
Daisy: We could take him with us.
Mack: I’ve been trapped in a moving vehicle with Lash before. Don’t love the idea of it happening again.
Daisy: Yes, if he has the DNA markers, we know where to find him. Let’s go.
Price: Cops finished up. Had my driver pick up some burgers for us. Figured you could use some dinner. DJ’s from around the corner?
Coulson: So, your computer’s still here. Couple of TVs, too. Some big-time art pieces, I noticed.
Price: Hardly big-time. Nice, maybe.
Coulson: Unusual for thieves to break in and not take anything.
Price: Well, lucky me. You got a point?
Coulson: I don’t know. If you were looking to earn some sympathy from me, soften me up, say, a staged break-in might be one way to do it.
Price: Interesting. Also interesting, my home had a break-in for the first time ever on the exact day you knew I’d be out.
Coulson: That’s a serious accusation.
Price: You just accused me of staging a break-in, which I did why, exactly?
Coulson: Maybe I won’t like what I see at the ATCU facility, so you’re trying to make me like you. Working me ever since the thunderbird. Humanizing yourself so I’ll take it better.
Price: Wow. I am quite the mad genius, huh?
Coulson: Is all this stuff really yours? I got to admit, the bat, that was a nice touch. Triple crown winners, autographs from Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski? Most people just looking at that wouldn’t know that it’s worth over 7 grand, but I do.
Price: Okay, the bat is not…
Coulson: And burgers from my favorite place, DJ’s. What possible reason would the head of the ATCU have for keeping me here with that?
Price: You’re right. No reason at all. You want to go see the facility? Fine. Let’s go see the facility.
Fitz: Okay, each of those passports has a different fake identity for Von Strucker. Uh… my work is better, just for the record.
Morse: We know.
Fitz: Right. Well, one I.D. matches the name on one Strucker real estate holding, a penthouse in Lisbon, Portugal. So I did a sweep of passengers arriving at the Lisbon airport. He went through customs several hours ago.
Morse: Nice work, Fitz. Thank you.
Fitz: You’re welcome.
Morse: So, we go to a penthouse in Lisbon.
May: You want to talk about what happened at the bank?
Morse: There’s nothing to discuss. I was treating fighting as a last resort. Usually, that’s good.
May: Usually. Sometimes it’s 'cause you’re gun shy.
Morse: Maybe I’m not 100%, but you’re the one who dragged me on this mission, in spite of the tests.
May: Stop hiding behind the tests.
Morse: I’m not. I said I wanted back in the field.
May: Sure. After Bahrain, I said I hated my cubicle. Didn’t mean it. Coulson says, “stay home,” and you just agree? Why are you keeping yourself locked up? You know, I saw you train at the academy once, scouting you.
Morse: I didn’t know that.
May: Strongest recruit I ever saw. Any test would’ve said you were 100% then. But you’re better today because now you have experience.
Morse: What Ward did, you think that was just experience?
May: That can make you stronger. Let it. 'Cause next time, talking our way out may not be an option.
Ward: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful with that one. Be a shame to see this whole place blow up before we even move in. What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be out looking for Von Strucker. Who is this?
Malick: You don’t know my name, but I think you’ve been trying to get my attention.
Ward: I’ve been wondering when I’d hear from you. You’re the one all the others were afraid of, before me.
Malick: Not everyone fears you, Mr. Ward.
Ward: Well, not everyone should. Just the ones who won’t fall in line. What can I do for you?
Malick: Now, that’s not the correct question. The correct question is what I can offer you. The answer, in case you’re wondering, is redemption.
Ward: Oh, no, thanks. I don’t need redeeming.
Malick: Oh, I think you do. You made some mistakes in your gameplay, using Von Strucker’s son as a pawn when he shouldn’t even be on the board yet.
Ward: You see, that’s just typical of guys in your generation. You don’t even know the game I’m playing. Von Strucker is more than just a pawn.
Malick: And now he’s a liability. He knows too much. Just tell me if I’m wrong. You burned that asset. S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for him, which means so are you. And I know where you can find him.
Ward: And you’ll just tell me that? Why?
Malick: Sometimes you sacrifice a player to save the game. You just remember when I come calling that I chose a side.
Mack: This is the place. Matches the Endotex location. High-voltage, zinc-coated razor wire, iris recognition? Staggered perimeter patrols. They don’t want any visitors. It’s got to be a front, don’t you think?
Hunter: So what now?
Daisy: Now we use the new dwarf Fitz crafted. He doesn’t think it’s ready yet, but that’s stupid because it’s awesome, so… I stole it. What? I didn’t say you were the only one with issues. All right.
Daisy: Simmons, what do you got?
Simmons: It’s negative. Banks has no Inhuman markers. He’s not Inhuman.
Daisy: So he’s not Lash. Really? I was so sure… Okay. Thanks.
Simmons: Fitz? I’m done helping Daisy. And since you’re done helping Bobbie and May, I thought maybe now we could take a look at the simulation.
Fitz: Um… Jemma, I’ve been meaning to say to you…
Simmons: Look, I understand if you don’t want to look into this. I’m stronger than you think.
Fitz: No, no, no, no, Jemma, I have looked into it. Actually, I’ve run dozens of simulations, and I kept on hoping that one of them… would work.
Simmons: Oh. I…
Fitz: I didn’t want to disappoint you. The Monolith was just one option, though. We’re not gonna give up, okay?
Simmons: I know this isn’t easy for you. It’s an odd situation.
Fitz: Yeah. It’s one of the oddest, even for us.
Simmons: Fitz, if you knew Will, you’d understand. I promise…
Fitz: Jemma, that’s the thing. I am gonna know him. It’s not even a question.
Hunter: I don’t care what the blood work says. That guy Banks is shifty. You know he once held me prisoner on a train. Didn’t care for that.
Mack: Banks was still on his way here. Endotex is obviously a front for ATCU. No, there’s something here.
Daisy: Maybe the dwarf will find something so today won’t have been pointless. Banks wanted to be here for a delivery of something. I wonder what it is.
Mack: But won’t they see the dwarf?
Daisy: They will not. That’s the 2.0.
Mack: Fitz should not be keeping that locked up. Uh… Wait, what is that?
Daisy: I don’t…
Man: Clear. Right side. Pick it up. Up!
Hunter: It’s that a person?
Daisy: Oh, god.
Hunter: Is he dead?
Daisy: No, they’re monitoring him. He’s alive.
Mack: But in some kind of what? A coma?
Daisy: This is ATCU. This is where they’re storing Inhumans they find. Like animals in cages. Let me get a better shot. Oh.
Hunter: Can we turn it up? I can’t hear a thing.
Daisy: It’s up. This is as close as we can get without giving ourselves away. There’s noise in the background.
Mack: I know how it looks.
Daisy: He should be freaking out. This is the sort of thing that should freak a person out. Why is he not burning this place to the ground?
Mack: He… He’s telling her what he thinks.
Hunter: He’s horrified, like we are.
Daisy: It doesn’t look like it.
Mack: Look, bring back that dwarf. Make sure we’re not discovered.
Daisy: There’s no way we’re working with the ATCU now.
Mack: Tremors… Daisy, the dwarf… bring it back.
Daisy: All right.
Coulson: It’s efficient, I’ll say that. What is it? Some kind of suspension gel?
Price: It keeps them in stasis. Alive, healthy, just asleep. You were right about one thing, I didn’t want to show you. Not because I think what we’re doing here is wrong. Because I know how it looks.
Coulson: Looks like a horror movie.
Price: Try to understand, these people were all in trouble after they turned. Some tried hurting themselves. Some hurt loved ones.
Coulson: Yes, they can be dangerous. I’ve seen that. But it doesn’t begin to just…
Price: This thing is like an illness. But we’re working on a cure, and we’re close… so close to telling those people, “you’re safe. Your loved ones are safe. You can go home.” It’s like putting someone in a medically induced coma to make them better. Imagine doing that for someone who has no other shot.
Coulson: You lost someone.
Price: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Coulson: I’m such an idiot for not seeing it. I’m sorry. Big baseball fan, I’m guessing.
Price: My husband.
Coulson: Not to this.
Price: No. No, it was years ago.
Coulson: In the field?
Price: No. That’s the funny part. I was the spy taking risks. He was a cardiologist, an honest man, a good husband, and cancer sucks.
Coulson: I’m sorry.
Price: I would’ve given anything to do this for him. Just put him to sleep for a little while until someone found a cure. I can do that for those people, for their families.
Coulson: I got to be honest, I didn’t expect…
Price: What? That I’m human?
Coulson: Not all of us are. Not fully.
Price: I am. And I think you are, too. But if you tell anyone I said that, I’ll find your base and blow it up. I find it hard to keep my humanity in all of this.
Coulson: Usually, you have to cut yourself off from it.
Price: I’m trying not to. Before, you said that you thought I wanted you to like me.
Coulson: Yeah. Sorry. That was…
Price: But that part might be a little… true. Maybe.
Coulson: Good.
May: Ready?
Kebo: You again. Good.
Strucker: Aah!
Morse: All right. Here we go.
May: Strucker. Strucker. Where do I find Ward?
Strucker: Ward… no… please…
Kebo: I’ve taken down men three times your size, girl. What makes you think you can beat me?
Morse: Experience.
Strucker: I tried to do what Ward wanted. I tried to kill him.
May: “Him?” Professor Garner?
Strucker: We had him. But I didn’t know he’d change into that thing.
May: What really happened?
May: That’s not true.
Strucker: No. What is he?
May: I don’t know.
Daisy: I told you, you don’t have to worry about me. Are you all right? Staying safe?
Lincoln: Safe as houses.
Daisy: What?
Lincoln: It’s an expression. People say that.
Daisy: Sure. And someday, you can tell me how you survived the dust bowl and the Hoover administration, grandpa.
Lincoln: It’s an ugly side of you, Daisy.
Daisy: That’s too bad. You know the deal. I stop making fun of you when you tell me where you are.
Lincoln: Yeah.
Daisy: Just… keep your head down, okay? I don’t want this thing to find you. Do you have any friends out there, at least?
Lincoln: Not as many as I used to. How much longer till the call is traceable?
Daisy: 15 seconds.
Lincoln: I’ll reach out soon.
Daisy: Hope so.
Daisy: Dr. Garner, hey.
Andrew: Was that Lincoln? He have anything to help us with Lash?
Daisy: Nope. Back to square one.
Andrew: Hmm. Don’t worry. You’ll figure it out soon. Hey, did Lincoln tell you where he is? I mean, he’d be safer here, under our protection.
Daisy: I know, but he doesn’t believe me. He won’t tell me. But I’ll let you know when he does.
Andrew: Great.
