Malick: The octopus is one of the great symbols of HYDRA. Supremely intelligent, highly adaptable, and they are ruthless killers. A nearly perfect predator. Same can be said of you.
Ward: Well, it’s a terrifying symbol, but not my idea of dinner. Then again, I am adaptable. I hope you can be, too.
Malick: Well, that depends on your request.
Ward: You’re one of the last heads of HYDRA’s old guard.
Malick: Thanks in no small part to you.
Ward: You should be thanking me. I trimmed the fat from your ranks.
Malick: You weren’t just trimming the fat going after the Von Strucker boy. You were digging. And I know what you were hoping to find. You’re chasing rumors, ghosts. The Von Strucker family vault does not exist.
Ward: Truthfully, I’d believe you if you hadn’t sacrificed the only heir to it. And you control the vault now, right? That vault is said to have HYDRA’s greatest power. Why don’t you and I put it to good use?
Malick: HYDRA is a complicated organization, and I don’t have time to give you a history lesson. I do have some long-standing plans that are finally coming together, and your simple vendetta doesn’t currently fit in with them.
Ward: I will find that vault.
Malick: You’re a smart predator. But you don’t live on top of the food chain.
Ward: Okay.
Ward: Well fought. So, Malick wanted me slaughtered, which means I’m on the right track. See, I know where the vault is. Just don’t know how to get in. Which creates a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for anyone who has accompanied him there.
Man: We’re not helping you.
Ward: Well, then. Who’s on the bottom of the food chain now?
Coulson: That’s the compound we used to tranquilize Andrew. Those tanks should be enough to keep him sedated if need be. Tell me we’re doing the right thing.
Price: We are. He’ll be put in stasis, held in human form, before that thing can completely take him over.
Coulson: And the cure you’re working on?
Price: We’re throwing everything we can at it.
Coulson: He was one of the good ones, is.
Price: I know he was a friend. You’re doing all you can. We’ll keep you up to speed on everything we do.
Coulson: Maybe you should come to the base in the next day or so, talk me through it.
Mack: Anyone gonna talk to her?
Coulson: She’ll talk when she’s ready.
Fitz: Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. Okay, just go before you drop another priceless manuscript. Why don’t you go deface a Picasso or something?
Simmons: Fitz, what are you doing?
Fitz: They’re all idiots.
Simmons: Be nice.
Fitz: Sorry. Well-meaning idiots. It’s been a rough day.
Simmons: You brought in all these books?
Fitz: Every volume on symbolic anthropology and iconography I could find. Hopefully it matches, um… this. It’s the ram’s head symbol. I think Will’s distant star Pathfinder program hid it in the logo.
Simmons: About 200 years after the group studying the Monolith chiseled it into the floor of the castle.
Fitz: Yeah. No coincidence there. If we get lucky, tracing its origin could give us some sort of insight into how to save…
Simmons: Sorry. Just feel so bad for May. I don’t know how you get over that.
Lincoln: She’s been giving me the hate stare since I got here. I had to sleep with one eye open last night.
Daisy: But you slept.
Lincoln: Yeah, for the first time in a long time. I’ve been running long enough to appreciate it, secret underground base no one knows about, even if you all live on top of each other like keebler elves.
Daisy: It’s one roof, but it’s big. Lots of space. Not that you need to keep your space.
Lincoln: I know. Uh… I’m sorry I moved in. I hope it’s not weird.
Daisy: Weird?
Lincoln: We kissed. That happened. Do we need to talk about it?
Daisy: Nope. We do not need to. Why don’t we just see what happens?
Lincoln: Will that happen again?
Daisy: Planning takes the fun out of it. Plus, you know, you’ll have tougher decisions to face, right? You can’t just stay here. Coulson only lets people in the base who have a role in his game plan.
Coulson: I feel like you’re gonna tell me I didn’t make little league all-stars.
Mack: It’s Rosalind, sir. I know you two have grown closer, and I’m concerned that maybe you might, uh… um, maybe you two…
Coulson: You can say it.
Mack: Are you sleeping together?
Coulson: That’s none of your business.
Mack: I’m sorry to press, sir, but I need to know. Do you have feelings for her, or are you playing an angle?
Coulson: Again, not your business. But you really think I’m that guy?
Mack: If not, then it is my business, because now you’re bringing her, the head of the ATCU, into our hidden base.
Coulson: Easy, Mack. I like Roz. Whether she can be trusted, yet to be determined.
Mack: How is that not a deal breaker?
Coulson: Because the only spies without trust issues are either young or dead. I hope I can trust Roz. I want to. That’s why I’m bringing her here face-to-face, so I can look her in the eye and find out. Meanwhile, the rest of you will have to go behind her back.
Coulson: Today, we’re launching Operation Spotlight. The objective? To peer into every shadowy corner of the ATCU. The last few days have been hard. What happened with Dr. Garner is tragic, but it has also created a rare moment of opportunity for us. The ATCU brought Dr. Garner’s containment module into their research facility. S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to use that as a way to gain access. Going in on the ground will be Bobbi and Hunter. Quarterbacking from Zephyr One will be Daisy and Mack. Handling extraction, May and…
May: Him.
Coulson: Okay. I guess the new guy will gain a firsthand look of our operations with Agent May. Let me be clear. I want to know everything, what’s inside the facility, how close they are to this cure they’ve been working on, which Inhumans they’re holding and where they came from, and finally, what it is the ATCU actually wants with them. Questions?
Daisy: Yeah. Why now?
Coulson: Because I think the head of the ATCU finally trusts me. I’d like that feeling to be mutual. Let’s get to work.
Coulson: That answer your concerns?
Mack: Just raises all new ones.
Ward: You’ve kept quiet. I admire that. These babies burn up to 2,600 degrees. I was a bit of a pyro when I was a kid. Got me into some real trouble. But damn if I don’t love the sound of that gas igniting. You have to incorporate what you love into your work. You see, the trick is, you want them to know it’s gonna hurt. Build anticipation. But you have to let them imagine a better world. You could walk into Strucker’s vault with me. You just have to show me how. We can go in there together, share what we find.
Man: You can torch us all you want! There’s nothing to tell! He uses different people when he travels to Zepkow. And even they don’t know where the vault’s buried.
Ward: Zepkow. Germany. I lied. Strucker has many vaults. I know them all. Just didn’t know Zepkow was the one I needed. Be proud. You stayed quiet. You would have fit in good with my men.
Coulson: Ms. Price. Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Price: Not exactly running things out of your mom’s basement, are we? Did you give it a slick code name?
Coulson: Classified. But to me, it’s home.
Price: That’s cute. Almost as cute as flying me in circles for six hours on a plane. I don’t know if I’m in Albuquerque or Albania.
Coulson: Imagine the possibilities. And be flattered. I waived our usual blindfold protocol.
Price: Oh, they’ll say you’re going soft, director. Then again, completely disabled my phone for the entire flight. Couldn’t even check my fantasy-football scores.
Coulson: Such cruelty. I can reactivate the phone, but we’ll need to sweep for wireless sniffers first.
Price: Two words I never want to hear again. Go for it, cowboy.
Coulson: You left your intelligence-gathering phone at your apartment, didn’t you?
Price: I almost didn’t, but I thought it might be rude.
Coulson: Please. We expect nothing less.
Mack: Incoming data upload from Rosalind’s phone.
Daisy: Okay. Let’s wake up the ATCU I.T. A.S.A.P.
Wilson: Oh, yeah. That’s my favorite episode. I mean, Darlene was set up perfectly… every word she said. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you see that? What was that?
Lincoln: Did you just hack the ATCU?
Daisy: No, but the containment module broadcasts some pretty intense encrypted homing signals. You put it inside a corporate office, and it’ll wig the I.T. department out real good.
Mack: FBI cyber investigative task force. How may I help you, Mr., uh, Wilson? What exactly is going on over there? Well, multiple agency servers have been attacked in the last few minutes, and the traffic traces back to your IPs. We’ve already, uh, dispatched a rapid-response unit to your location. Please, just cooperate fully. Should be fine. I can assure you, they’re our absolute best.
Wilson: Listen, Agent Phillips, our systems check out perfectly, okay? We’re showing no signs of a breach. I don’t think you’ll be necessary here. I think that it was a glitch.
Hunter: A glitch, yeah. Of course it looks like a glitch. That’s the point. You congratulate yourself, crisis averted, then go home, never noticing the polymorphic root kit buried deep inside your system…
Daisy: Until hackers activate it to…
Hunter: … bypass that sweet, stateless multi…
Daisy: … factor authentication…
Hunter: … code you are so bloody proud of.
Wilson: Red Sox fan?
Hunter: Red coats, actually.
Wilson: This guy does not look like FBI.
Morse: He wasn’t. Dane here crashed the Pentagon servers, Mossad’s, Ashley Madison. He’s the best consultant we have. Otherwise, he’d be in jail or I’d have shot him by now. If he says that you have a problem, listen.
Wilson: Our system’s airtight.
Morse: Yeah. If your system’s so secure, how’d your staff’s credentials leak out?
Wilson: What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. There’s no way someone got past our software.
Hunter: Who said anything about software? We think hardware was smuggled in. You called, detecting some sort of broadcast?
Wilson: The ATCU security is way too strong.
Morse: Was nothing brought into this facility in the last 24 hours?
Wilson: No. Our employee’s keys don’t make it past security. We haven’t brought in anything, except the, uh… Oh, no. I need to make a phone call.
Coulson: We’ve had some major breakthroughs here. Advances in alien biology, robotics, prosthetics.
Price: Well, it cuts a hell of a silhouette.
Coulson: You know, they mostly got it right.
Price: So you did reactivate it. Hello, I.T. department that calls me only when there’s a problem. What’s the problem?
Wilson: There’s an FBI task force here. An energy pulse was detected inside our facility right before, um… an apparent security leak.
Price: Have you found the cause?
Wilson: Well, ma'am, I think it could be the S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module we brought in.
Price: Dearest, is it possible that your containment module tried to access the ATCU’s system?
Coulson: Absolutely. It scans any local network it finds. All our hardware does.
Price: Well, we noticed, and we’re gonna have to go ahead and shut that down.
Coulson: Can’t blame a guy for trying.
Price: Hey, Steve, you’re supposed to protect the ATCU from things like this. So play nice with the FBI’s task force, and fix it. You’re lucky you’re cute.
Coulson: We really have to figure out other ways to flirt.
Fitz: Are you alphabetizing those?
Simmons: Don’t be ridiculous. I’m organizing them by subject and date.
Fitz: No, you’re procrastinating.
Simmons: Is there something so terrible about a comprehensive system?
Fitz: Why don’t you want to go look into one of…
Simmons: I’ve been looking. I just don’t like what I’m seeing.
Fitz: You found a lead?
Simmons: Will wasn’t sent on a mission. He was sacrificed. The symbol used for his space program? Tied to ritualistic blood sacrifice. People working with NASA. Between this and Andrew, I have that sinking feeling again, Fitz. That we never really know who’s next to us.
Ward: Thank you. These should keep me warm. This gonna get you in trouble?
Flight attendant: Up here, I control everything.
Ward: Always? You ever find yourself completely out of control?
Flight attendant: I’ll be in Moscow soon enough with a day off. Come see for yourself.
Ward: I wish I could, but I’m not going to Moscow. This was the only flight I could find passing over Zepkow.
Ward: Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats, and keep your seatbelts fastened. You may experience some turbulence coming up. Don’t be alarmed. That’s just your pilot diving to equalize cabin pressure before you freeze to death. Oh, and, uh… from all of us here at HYDRA, thanks for flying the friendly skies.
Fitz: These symbols trace back thousands of years, groups obsessed with death and ritualistic killings. It’s intertwined with the origin of pagan devil myths.
Simmons: And then, suddenly, there they were, secretly funding NASA missions.
Fitz: They knew something. These texts go back 1,000 years.
Simmons: Fitz, there’s nothing in here to help open the portal.
Fitz: Of course there is.
Simmons: No, it’s just copious examples of how this group was evil and used Will as a blood offering.
Fitz: But if we can find out their goal, we can find out how they tried to achieve it. Even if we have to stay up all night, we’ll find something… something to help us bring back Will.
Simmons: You have to stop!
Fitz: Excuse me?
Simmons: Stop! Just stop trying to do all the right things! It’s too much.
Price: Is this a silver tie-clip camera?
Coulson: Platinum. 1963.
Price: Wow. You really are a S.H.I.E.L.D. lifer. I bet there’s a story behind each one of these that I’d love to hear.
Coulson: I have a real soft spot for that golden age.
Price: They recruit you out of college?
Coulson: Mm-hmm.
Price: Studying…
Coulson: History. I started to inadvertently uncover how much of that history S.H.I.E.L.D. had helped to shape, so they snatched me up. So, you’ve really never known anyone in S.H.I.E.L.D.? I find that hard to believe.
Price: Only in passing.
Coulson: Come on. You can tell me if you have. I’m the director. You’re inside our secret base.
Price: You know, I hate to disappoint you, Phil, but until recently, I was in the normal intelligence game, not paranormal. You’re my first. Hmm. You know, I got to admit. I didn’t picture you keeping things so analog.
Coulson: Yeah, files, book, vinyl. There’s a tactile benefit, the way they feel in your hands, the wear and tear.
Price: Oh, the smell. Ah. I love the smell of books.
Coulson: Helps me think. Besides, we both know how vulnerable the digital world is to infiltration.
Hunter: So sorry, Steve-O. Nothing worse for an I.T. guy than someone logging into a terminal. Makes you feel violated, doesn’t it?
Wilson: How do we know he’s not just looking for exploits to get into our system when it goes back to being a black hat?
Morse: Oh, there’s no going back for Dane.
Hunter: But I am here to find the exploits, and I’m gonna need a log-in to determine if…
Daisy: … the trojan horse hardware emitted a signal pulse that allows access…
Hunter: … through your UDP or TCP ports, mate. Have you checked that yet?
Wilson: You can use a command prompt to enter a guest username.
Daisy: And unwittingly give us remote access. Okay, Hunter, type this in. C, colon, forward slash, “System”, Forward slash, “Request user.” Hunter. Oh, god. Hunter. Please tell me you know which one is forward slash.
Hunter: Yes. Typing. I’m just helping your sluggish code keep up.
Wilson: Hilarious.
Daisy: And the username.
Hunter: The username, “God save the Queen.”
Daisy: Yeah, I let him pick it.
Hunter: Bingo.
Daisy: May, you’re up.
Mack: Agent May said she wants you with her on this, yeah?
Lincoln: Yeah.
Mack: Well, then, I suggest you move your ass. There. Bobbi, enhanced specimen control. North, stairs at the end of the hall, three floors down in the science division. Ringing your phone now.
Morse: Hmm. My superiors on Pennsylvania Avenue. I need to step away for a moment to give them my full report.
Wilson: Okay.
Daisy: Check that section. See how many Inhumans they’re keeping in there.
Mack: And grab any samples of the potential cure.
Daisy: Now all Hunter has to do is run his mouth and waste time.
Morse: Oh, he excels at that. Daisy? Thank you.
Lincoln: Here? So, you need me to do anything? Why bring me if you’re not even gonna talk to me?
Fitz: Where do you get off? Are you seriously mad at me?
Simmons: I’m mad at myself for roping you into this! It’s not fair. And I’m mad that you’re so willing to help.
Fitz: As opposed to what? What do you expect?
Simmons: I don’t know! Get angry. I cannot fathom any way out of this without hurting someone I care about.
Fitz: You think that I’m not angry?! I’m sick to my stomach. I’m furious, but not at you! ‘Cause we’re cursed. The bloody cosmos wants us to be apart.
Simmons: The cosmos doesn’t want anything.
Fitz: Yeah, well, I beg to differ. ‘Cause we had years side-by-side. Never occurred to us. And then when it does, we don’t have the courage to talk about it.
Simmons: Well, you only mentioned it at the bottom of the sea, facing certain death.
Fitz: You wait until I’m bound for a war on an aircraft carrier, and then you get swept off to some far-flung planet. With him. Top-marks pilot astronaut hero man.
Simmons: I would do anything…
Fitz: Do you love him?
Simmons: I don’t know. I think… Yes.
Fitz: Yeah, of course you do. Of course you do. He’s strong and smart, and you gave each other hope on the edge of nowhere.
Simmons: Don’t do this, Fitz.
Fitz: You think I didn’t look for dirt on him? I did. And there’s nothing. I can’t hate him. He’s great. Why else would you fall for him? He did everything right.
Simmons: And you dove through a hole in the universe for me!
Fitz: We’re cursed.
Simmons: Fitz, is that what I think it is?
Morse: Andrew was a PhD in psychology. Now he’s a specimen. Open sesame.
Malick: Dr. Garner, I’m so sorry about everything.
Andrew: No one warned me there’d be a flight. Who are you?
Malick: I’m Gideon Malick. I advise the president’s staff, And I want to assure you that we’re working with S.H.I.E.L.D. to do everything we can to help you.
Andrew: With what? A cure? I know how pharmaceuticals work. What are you? A decade away from treatment? 
Malick: It strikes me that no one’s asked if you even want treatment. They haven’t asked your opinion on the situation at all, have they?
Andrew: No. But, then, all they see is a killer.
Malick: Well, surely, you have taken a hard stance, but, then, this is an invading alien contagion which S.H.I.E.L.D. has known about for quite some time.
Malick: They protected no one, including you.
Andrew: There’s more nuance to S.H.I.E.L.D. than that. Why worry about them?
Malick: S.H.I.E.L.D. has good intentions but questionable methods.
Andrew: That much is true. They can’t help themselves from jumping into the deep end of dangerous waters.
Malick: We agree on more than we don’t. I can help you, Dr. Garner. But first, I need to know what else S.H.I.E.L.D. has been hiding from us.
Morse:: Andrew isn’t here. Guys, are you sure this is the right area?
Daisy: That’s the place.
Morse: Well, there are no Inhumans being held here. Let Coulson know. And as far as a cure, it doesn’t look like they’re taking tissue samples, studying cell response. Not in here, anyway.
Mack: If they’re not working on a cure in there, then what are they doing?
Morse: Wait. Daisy, anything on medications they’ve compiled for study? Because I’m not positive, but those look an awful lot like fish-oil pills.
Daisy: I’ll look.
Hunter: There’s no better time to be a hacker, really. I mean, nowadays, every human on the planet, kids have computers in their pockets, you know? Instead of stealing candy from a baby, you’re stealing their parents’ credit-card information.
Wilson: Okay, I’m gonna grab some coffee.
Hunter: Mm-hmm. I’ll have a cup of tea, please. Thanks. Oh, bollocks. Uh, people, it’s time to download everything we can and make our getaway. Our friend Mr. Banks has just showed up, and I do not have a handkerchief to cover my face. And that would be weird, anyhow.
Mack: Copy that.
Daisy: They’re not studying medication, Bobbi. They’re administering them, giving mandatory supplements to all their employees.
Mack: “To prevent infection”, uh, soldiers, office workers. And it says, “any public witnesses.” Oh, no.
Daisy: They’re playing the odds, giving Terrigen to as many people as they can. They’re not trying to cure Inhumans, they’re…
Morse: They’re turning them.
Price: Hmm. Do you expect me to stay in this room overnight, Phil? 'Cause I might need a little persuading.
Coulson: No, it’s you who needs to convince me.
Price: Convince you?
Coulson: That you’re not HYDRA. Otherwise, you’re never leaving this room again.
Price: What a hell you’re doing, Phil?
Coulson: Getting the truth out of you once and for all.
Price: Is this a joke?
Coulson: I’m not laughing.
Price: What, you think there’s some hidden secret you can just scare out of me?
Coulson: I have my people infiltrating your facility. I’m getting the truth regardless, so this is your final chance to come clean.
Price: They won’t find anything out that I wouldn’t happily tell them.
Coulson: What’s wrong with you? Stop lying. Why don’t you tell me who you really are, who you work for, and what you’re hiding?
Price: What the hell is wrong with you? Look at you.
Coulson: I’m done playing games.
Price: I wasn’t playing games. I thought… I thought there was something between us, something real that wasn’t just based in this spycraft-manipulation crap.
Coulson: You really think this emotional appeal’s gonna work right now?
Price: No, because you have no emotions. This was all a plan? To sleep with me, gain trust, and take advantage?
Coulson: Don’t try to talk your way out of this.
Price: Or even sadder, you didn’t plan to sleep with me, but you just have such deep issues that you stopped trusting me as soon as you did.
Coulson: You lied to me. Andrew isn’t being kept at your ATCU facility, is he?
Price: Of course not.
Lincoln: Are you torturing me? Is that the idea? Drag me around, waiting for the other shoe to drop? I know how dangerous you are. But if you blame me for bringing out the monster in that man, I’m not apologizing for that.
May: I’ve been trying to figure out what to say, because I do want to apologize, to you. For Andrew. He killed your friends in cold blood, tried to kill you. I’m sorry. I should’ve known.
Lincoln: I should be thanking you for being willing to put those bullets in him when you did.
Daisy: May, Bobbi and Hunter may need extraction sooner than we thought.
Morse: Can’t charm my way out of this one. Hunter, I’m gonna need you to get down here, and bring me my briefcase. Hunter?
Wilson: Almost finished?
Hunter: Uh, yeah, things have got really complicated in here just now. Um, listen, Steve, you seem like a really good guy, and you were spot-on about not being able to trust me, just wrong about why. See, I’m not very good at computers.
Wilson: Aah!
Hunter: Now, now, now!
Morse: Gonna need that briefcase!
Hunter: Coming as fast as I can, love.
Price: Of course we don’t keep Inhumans at that facility. We can’t risk some duplicitous nut case breaking in to look around. Looks like we made the right move.
Coulson: You’re always one step ahead.
Price: I feel like an idiot that I thought you were different.
Coulson: Stop with the mind games! I’ll admit, you’re good. Pretending to fall for me, well enough that I actually went along for the ride. But in the back of my mind, I always had one finger on the eject button.
Price: That’s because you’re incapable of anything else.
Coulson: No. Because you slipped up. Tahiti. The first time we met, you tried to get under my skin, talking about Tahiti. So I was hoping against all hope that today, you would confirm a high-level source from within S.H.I.E.L.D., but you claim you have none.
Price: That’s because I’ve been honest.
Coulson: The only other possible way that you could know about that is if you got your intel from HYDRA. So why don’t you share your source?
Price: I’m not sharing anything with you anymore.
Coulson: I didn’t think so.
Price: Except for this. You know what? To be honest, I did fall for you, Phil. I did. But it turns out you’re impenetrable. You like to joke about your robot hand and not being human. I’m not sure you’re so off the mark.
Coulson: Yeah, that means a lot coming from you.
Price: You were stabbed through the heart. You must derive sadistic pleasure in doing the same to others.
Coulson: At least I didn’t use the story of my dead husband to sell the idea that the ATCU was working on a cure when we both know that’s a lie.
Price: How dare you mention…
Coulson: Oh, cut the melodrama. My agent at the center of your compound confirmed that you’re not trying to cure Inhumans. You’re making as many as you can.
Price: What are you talking about?
Coulson: “Enhanced specimen control.” They’re inside, Roz, so you know what they found.
Price: No. No one’s allowed on those floors for risk of infection.
Coulson: Intentional infection. I got to admit, handing out the contaminant as a cure…
Price: No, that’s not what we…
Coulson: That’s especially sinister.
Price: No, I get weekly reports fr… from Malick.
Coulson: Excuse me?
Price: Gideon Malick.
Coulson: I know the name. Industrialist. He once served on the world council.
Price: He’s a friend. I’ve worked with him more than a decade. H-He advises the president’s staff, helped design the ATCU, oversees the science… division. He gave me the Tahiti intel.
Mack: Connection’s down.
Daisy: Look. Last file we pulled, a catalog of all the Inhumans they turned and put into stasis. But…
Mack: Let me guess. They didn’t put them all in stasis.
Morse: Oh, once again, too little and too late.
Hunter: I’ll remind you that we’re basically the same height. I just don’t wear bloody heels.
Hunter: Aliens. I pine for the days where we didn’t have to fight bloody aliens. It’s just not a fair fight.
Morse: Let’s see if we can level the playing field.
Hunter: Really? Your batons? That’s your game-changer?
Hunter: Well, all right, then.
Price: Let me make a call to my people.
Coulson: Your people? Yeah, I don’t see that happening.
Price: If Malick went to these lengths, your agents are in serious danger. I can get them out.
Coulson: Or sell them out.
Price: Phil, look at me. Please believe that I don’t know what’s going on. We need answers, both of us. And if you don’t let me get on the phone right now, we lose everything.
Morse: Oh, that’ll buy us very little time.
Banks: Come with me. I’ll get you out of here. If you’re worried you can’t trust me, worry on the move.
Price: He’ll lead them to the Northwest parking lot.
Coulson: You hear that?
Mack: May is en route.
May: I don’t see them. Got them.
Malick: I’m hardly ever impressed. I’ve shaken hands with presidents, held technology from other planets. Didn’t really faze me. But I got to tell ya, I’m at a loss for words.
Ward: You left me to die.
Malick: I left those men there to kill ya, but you, you cut through them like cake. And to locate this place, much less get here? Phew! I only got here a few minutes before you, and I have my own jet.
Ward: This was all just a test?
Malick: No, I wanted you dead. You pose a legitimate threat to everything that I’ve built. But now… now I’m beginning to think that maybe I was looking at it from the wrong angle. You just might be HYDRA’s second head that’s grown right next to me.
Ward: I should kill you.
Malick: Then you’d miss that history lesson we’ve been talking about. I know you’re all about rebooting HYDRA and all that. But do you know much about our history, our origin?
Ward: Yeah. World War II. Red Skull. He used Nazi funding to build this whole…
Malick: Oh, no, no. Red Skull was following the principal that  HYDRA was built upon, that the ultimate power was not of this world. But HYDRA… well, we’re much, much older than that. HYDRA’s actually as ancient as this stone. This one here and other surviving stones like it have been passed down for 100 generations. Keep your eye on it, Mr. Ward. You don’t want to miss it when it does its thing. This was cut from a much larger stone, a monolith that possesses otherworldly properties. Literally. It’s a portal to another world.
Price: He recruited me in '01. I met him when his company was consulting on a program at…
Simmons: At NASA.
Price: Yes, how did you…
Malick: Thousands of years ago, an Inhuman was born on this planet that was destined to rule it, so powerful, so fearsome that others were consumed with dread, and so they banished it from the Earth, sent it through the portal to a distant planet. Hydra was founded with the sole purpose of engineering its return. Over generations, Hydra’s taken different shapes. The entity has been given different names. But every generation has sent men through the portal, hoping to save or at least serve our leader on the other side. Now we’re building an army for it to command when it returns, and you and I will rule beside it.
Ward: Okay. That’s, uh, a lot to take in.
Malick: Well, it’s a tall tale. I know.
Ward: And why exactly should I believe a word of it?
Malick: Because we’re closer than ever to the final chapter. We’re gonna write it ourselves. But you don’t have to believe me. I know you want revenge, to cut the head off of S.H.I.E.L.D., to watch it writhe. I’ll help you do that.
Ward: And in return?
Malick: You’ll help me learn how S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to achieve something with the portal that Hydra, in thousands of years, has never been able to accomplish.
Ward: And what is that?
Malick: They brought someone back.
Andrew: Hey! Hey! Someone want to fill me in? How long are you gonna keep me in here without any idea of what’s going on? No, no, no, no, no, no! I don’t need to be sedated anymore. I just… I just… I need to talk to someone about what’s going on.
Ward: All right. Let’s talk. I could use a session with you, doc. I seem to be carrying around a lot of baggage these days. It’s nice to finally meet you. My name is Grant…
Andrew: I know who you are. What are you doing here?
Ward: Learning. Spent a good few days educating myself. Now we get to learn about you.
Andrew: You feeling powerful behind this glass? Well, you’re gonna die with a hole in your chest. You can try to sedate me, but I promise…
Ward: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, this isn’t the sedation compound from S.H.I.E.L.D. This is chloroethyl sulfide… something. It’s, uh, basically mustard gas. You see, S.H.I.E.L.D. showed us how to turn the monster off. Now we want to know how to turn that back on. Oh, uh, I also wanted to thank you for helping me find closure. You see, I thought I knew all the best ways to bring Melinda pain. But you… May thinks I’m a monster, but you actually become one.
Andrew: Aah!
Ward: I guess we know her type.
