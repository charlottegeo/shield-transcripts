Vanchat: 100% premium-grade Chitauri metal, as rare as it gets.
Deville: How’d you get your hands on this, Vanchat?
Vanchat: It’s what I do … Find alien scrap that no one else can, then offer it to people who fully appreciate my efforts.
Deville: Mm, I appreciate the hell out of them. You can name your price. Is that a roomba? Aah!
May: Fitz-Simmons, he’s heading your way.
Simmons: We’ve never done anything like this before. Are you sure?
Fitz: It’s time, Simmons. Embrace the change.
Ward: Skye, you’re up.
Skye: Here. Let me get that for you.
Hand: Mr. Vanchat. We were hoping you could help us find a friend.
Simmons: Impressive. You actually managed to reopen all your stitches.
Ward: Just hope Vanchat can lead us to Centipede.
Simmons: Well, the Chitauri metal he was selling is an exact match to what Centipede used for their device.
Ward: We find Centipede, we find Coulson.
Fitz: Don’t ask questions, Agent Kob. Just get me the five-millimeter injector. That’s an order.
Kob: Yes sir.
Fitz: Honestly, how many agents do they think they can cram on this plane?
Ward: It’s only gonna get more crowded. We’re set to pick up more men when Agent Hand dumps Vanchat off at the fridge.
Simmons: Honestly, I think it’s good they’re here. We need fresh eyes. It’s been 36 hours since Agent Coulson was taken, and none of us have gotten any rest.
Fitz: Oh, joy. Agent Hand is giving another briefing.
Hand: The burnt remains recovered at the site are believed to be those of Agent trainee Michael Peterson. Other physical evidence has proven scarce. Nothing relating to Mr. Po, his Centipede associates, or their location has been found.
Ward: Any progress with Vanchat?
Hand: Nothing actionable, Agent Ward, but I have my best interrogator in there right now. Vanchat will talk, and rest assured, when he does, not a single stone will be left unturned until we take down Centipede.
Simmons: And find Agent Coulson.
Fitz: And get Coulson back.
Hand: We have a security breach. Someone’s hacking the system.
Skye: Just in time. Can you override this?
Hand: What do you think you’re doing?
Skye: The money trail’s our key to finding Coulson. I just need to gain access to Vanchat’s financials, and from there, I should be able to trace Centipede’s payments and then hack into their account.
Hand: You’re the consultant… the one who shot Agent Sitwell.
Skye: Technically, that wasn’t me…
Hand: I want you off this plane immediately.
Ward: What?
Skye: Wait. I know I’m not some badass field agent like May or Ward, but this is what I do. You can’t just kick me off this mission. Listen, I will do whatever you say. All this protocol crap doesn’t matter to me. All that matters to me is Coulson.
Hand: Well, “all this protocol crap” matters to me. You’re a distraction, and you’re gone.
Ward: Agent Hand, I know Skye’s methods are unorthodox, but she’s a member of this team. She can help.
Hand: Agent May, your professional opinion… Will this girl be of any use to us on this plane?
May: No.
Hand: Increase her restriction level. Confiscate her laptop and phone, then have her delivered to debrief.
Ward: I’ll do it. I’m her S.O.
Skye: It’s clear that May has an axe to grind with me, but that was way out of line.
Ward: No one knows what’s in May’s head except May. Don’t worry. Coulson will make this right when he gets back.
Skye: I can find him, Ward.
Ward: I believe you. I’ve seen firsthand what you can do, even without S.H.I.E.L.D. resources.
Fitz: Hang on, hang on.
Simmons: We have something for you.
Skye: You made me a sandwich?
Simmons: Yes, it is that.
Fitz: It’s a satellite phone… damper resistant. You get one shot before your bracelet shuts it down.
Simmons: So only call in case of emergency.
Skye: What do I even need this for? I’m gonna be spending the next three days in a S.H.I.E.L.D. broom closet getting debriefed.
Ward: That’s right. A few agents are coming here to pick you up for debriefing… in exactly 12 minutes. Good luck.
Skye: Don’t touch Lola.
Coulson: Mm.
Karine: Can you feel that?
Coulson: Don’t stop.
Waiter: Listen to him. Who ordered this?
Po: It seems you passed out. Now maybe you’re ready to share what memories you’re seeing.
Coulson: I saw… Jordan… hitting that game-winner over Russell in the ‘98 finals. So clutch.
Po: Agent Coulson, we’re gonna turn the machine back on and open your mind. It’s time to stop fighting it. If you don’t, you won’t survive the process.
Coulson: I’ll let you kill me before I give you anything. Seems you have a taste for that, anyway… murdered Mike Peterson in front of his own son.
Po: Mr. Peterson chose that end. We gave him his life and his child unscathed. You’re just upset because that man’s death hit so close to home, seeing a boy lose his father at such a young age. As you did. A defining moment. The Clairvoyant saw that.
Coulson: I hate to break it to you, but your telepathic friend is a fraud. Otherwise, he’d know all these answers, and I wouldn’t be here.
Po: It’s true… this is strange. My friend can see that you died. You went cold. Your heart was torn to pieces. What the Clairvoyant can’t see is what happened after… how they brought you back from the dead. For some reason, Agent Coulson, you’re different. Now, why is that? So we have to do this the hard way.
Skye: Just need an exploit… some way in.
Man: Oh, what? Come on! Something with wireless, maybe.
Skye: Hey, Lloyd. You might be my way in.
Rathman: That’s what I said.
Valet: Yeah. One second.
Rathman: Of course, I love truffles, but not on that. What an idiot.
Skye: No, sweetie, listen to me. It was a private jet. Of course there was wi-fi. He should’ve at least texted you back.
Simmons: No, that’s too much! I know the night-night rounds no longer affect the Centipede soldiers, but all we want to do is disable them, not kill them.
Fitz: I’m good with either, frankly.
Simmons: Fitz, you don’t mean that. Those soldiers are just men who…
Fitz: Who could smash your skull open with a single punch.
Simmons: But they’re being controlled. Centipede is making them fight against their will.
Fitz: Well, they took Coulson, and I don’t care what we have to do to get him back. We need to bring him home.
Ward: What’s this guy doing, lulling Vanchat to sleep? I’m going in.
Skye: Damn it! Okay, Skye, just need a plan “B.”
Computer: Roadside assistance. We see you’ve had an accident.
Skye: Yeah. Can you send somebody to tow me back to my house?
Computer: Of course. I’ll dispatch someone right away. Are you okay?
Skye: Yeah. I’m good.
Ward: Agent Hand needs you, says it’s urgent. Time to talk. The names of all your buyers, alphabetically would help.
Vanchat: I’m not telling you a bloody thing.
Ward: That’s how you want to play it?
Fitz: Rochambeau you? Rochambeau!
Simmons: Scissors! Fitz!
Vanchat: Aah!
Ward: I’ve got all day.
Vanchat: All right! All right, I’ll talk! I’ll talk!
Po: The town that the bomb forgot. It was built in the ‘40s for nuclear testing, but when the cold war ended, the town was spared.
Coulson: Not exactly prime real estate.
Po: Mm, true. There’s nothing but desert for hundreds of miles. But I really like it. It’s nice here. The children are always playing… yet never make a sound. Shall we get back to it, then?
Man: So, you sure you don’t want me to take it to the dealer?
Skye: No, thanks. I got a guy.
Man: All right. Thank you.
Skye: Dollar bills, y'all.
Woman: Lloyd Rathman’s office.
Skye: This is the L.A.P.D. I need to speak with Mr. Rathman. We’ve recovered a stolen vehicle registered in his name.
Woman: Oh. Was it damaged?
Skye: Yes, ma'am. We have two officers waiting at his home, ready to take a statement. How long do you think it’ll take Mr. Rathman to get there?
Skye: You’re in a lot of trouble, Mr. Rathman.
Rathman: Who the hell are you?
Skye: Agent Melinda May with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Rathman: Look, clearly there’s been a misunderstanding. I’m a legitimate businessman.
Skye: S.H.I.E.L.D. has evidence your company has been siphoning funds into an offshore account for some very bad people.
Rathman: My clients’ business is their business.
Skye: Well, my business is catching those guys, and if it turns out you’ve made a profit from just one of them, S.H.I.E.L.D. is prepared to freeze all of your assets.
Rathman: I’m calling my lawyer.
Skye: Do that and my offer’s off the table.
Rathman: What offer is that?
Skye: Immunity… you walk… free and clear. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t touch a single asset. Not even your party boat in Key Largo.
Rathman: And if I say no?
Skye: You spend the next five years in the fridge.
Rathman: The fridge?
Skye: It’s worse than it sounds.
Rathman: All right, what do you want?
Skye: Follow me to your office. We’ve got some work to do.
Hand: Vanchat’s intel is paying off. We’re pursuing every known buyer of Chitauri metals around the globe. The largest has a warehouse in Sydney. We’re heading there now. This is our chance to take down Centipede. I want everyone in full tactical.
Ward: And what about Agent Coulson?
Hand: If we’re lucky, Centipede’s holding him in Sydney. Dismissed. Agent Ward, a moment. First, your friend Skye left the plane and never arrived for her debrief, then Vanchat almost flies out of the interrogation room. Do we have a problem?
Ward: No, Agent Hand. Your man wasn’t getting answers, so I stepped in.
Hand: Without my permission. Well, congratulations. Thanks to you and your unique interrogation skills, we now have active strike teams running raids all over the world. The question is, why?
Ward: Excuse me?
Hand: It’s unprecedented, this kind of response for a level 8 operative, the sheer manpower involved. I’ve been on the phone all day… Director Fury, Commander Hill… everyone wants an update. Frankly, I don’t understand it. No single agent is that important.
Ward: Coulson is.
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s gonna find me before you break me.
Po: S.H.I.E.L.D.? Well, the Clairvoyant sees an end to all that.
Raina: He doesn’t look so good.
Po: Raina, what took you so long?
Raina: I was tending to our other subject.
Po: The persuasion skills I’ve spoken to the Clairvoyant so much about would be better served here with me, breaking this man.
Raina: I would never use force to bend a man to my wishes.
Po: He’s being difficult.
Raina: He’s being beaten.
Po: Into submission. The Clairvoyant requested it and will tell me to… See? Yes? No. Well, I’ve only just begun. My methods are sound. I assure you… Right here. Yes. The Clairvoyant would like to speak to you.
Raina: This is Raina. Yes. I agree. Thank you. I’ll put him back on.
Po: Yes, I’m here.
May: There a problem?
Ward: Victoria Hand. We don’t exactly see eye to eye.
May: I’m sure she’s utilizing all of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s resources to find Coulson.
Ward: Not all of them. You know, it wouldn’t hurt to have Skye working an exploit. Why didn’t you stick up for her?
May: Excuse me?
Ward: She has proven herself on multiple missions. She’s a part of this team. You let her get tossed.
May: All I did was tell Hand the truth. Skye’s no use to us on this plane.
Ward: How can you say that?
May: She’s not. Not with all these agents here over her shoulder, monitoring her every move.
Ward: You wanted her off the plane.
May: Outside the system. That’s how Skye works best. You don’t have to assume the worst of me.
Hand: Agent May, change of plans. Sending new coordinates now. We found their helicopter at a laboratory outside the Mojave desert.
May: Copy that. Coordinates received. Hang on to something.
Rathman: You want me to hack into a Swiss bank account?
Skye: Just need you to type in your private corporate I.D. to get me in the door.
Rathman: Yeah, well, letting you in that door is a crime. Come to think of it, how do I know you’re not just some criminal? In my experience, a federal agent shows a badge.
Skye: You want to see my badge. S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol six alpha victor. There. That’s my badge.
Rathman: Great. Just got my high score in Tiny Wings.
Skye: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s been watching you for quite some time, Mr. Rathman. You’re a prime exploit… the gambling, the divorces, that money pit in the Caymans. You’re even behind on your child-support payments.
Rathman: Ugh, that’s a clerical thing. My ex knows that.
Skye: But does David know that?
Rathman: David thinks I’m a cool dad.
Skye: David thinks you’re a jackass. You got to fix that, Lloyd. Kids need someone they can look up to. Now… start typing.
Officer 1: PD security! Don’t move! That’s it. Nice and easy. Keep your hands where I can see it…
Skye: Ugh!
Officer 2: On the ground!
Rathman: Okay, I-I’m typing, I’m typing. You S.H.I.E.L.D. guys don’t mess around.
Raina: This is turning into an interesting day, isn’t it?
Coulson: So, you’re my friend now? 'Cause I’ve seen what you do to your “friends.”
Raina: Mr. Po?
Coulson: Yeah.
Raina: He was a murderer incapable of remorse.
Coulson: I was thinking of Mike Peterson, Chan Ho Yin.
Raina: I gave them what they asked for. Mike wanted to be a hero to his son. Now he is.
Coulson: Did Akela Amador want a bomb in her head?
Raina: The people you work for are just as capable of using cruel means to reach a justified end.
Coulson: And who do you work for, Raina? The Clairvoyant?
Raina: Yes.
Coulson: Who is he?
Raina: I don’t know. Today was the first time I personally made contact. My heart’s still racing.
Coulson: He has you building super soldiers.
Raina: The Clairvoyant gives us guidance, formulas.
Coulson: For what?
Raina: The changing world, the world your organization brought upon us. We’re new to the business of what you’ve been doing for decades.
Coulson: So now what? You have soldiers? You can make them strong, you can control them. In an instant, you can kill them.
Raina: Yes, but we can’t bring them back to life. You were killed. Now you’re here. We want to know how. Don’t you? I’d like to turn the machine on again. It induces theta brain-wave frequencies to help uncover the secrets buried in the subconscious. If you cooperate, you can surf those waves.
Coulson: I’ve gone surfing. That is definitely not like surfing.
Raina: You’ve been resisting. Fight the waves and you’ll drown. Your brain will cook. You’ll stop breathing… again.
Coulson: Then that’s what it’ll be, or I hold out until my team comes to find me. Either way, you will not get classified intel from me.
Raina: I’m not interested in those secrets. The Clairvoyant can see within any agency, any government. He knows what the President dreams about at night. I want what you want… to uncover a different secret… the secret S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping from you.
Rathman: All right, we’re logged in, but you do realize you can’t transfer these kinds of funds online.
Skye: I’m not looking to transfer funds. I’m looking for transaction records. Go to your account history. We need to open up a terminal emulator, see what kind of encryption they’ve got.
Rathman: Okay.
Skye: If it’s an SSL 256 or an A.E.S. twofish serpent, we’re in business.
Rathman: Yeah.
Skye: Quantum key, that’s another story.
Rathman: Right.
Skye: Lloyd. What is happening here?
Rathman: Yeah, account history. Where is that?
Skye: Delete that second line. Press “return.”
Rathman: Thing is, I have an assistant that does all this for me.
Skye: That’s it.
Officer: So, this Vanchat… is this the guy you’re trying to bust?
Skye: No, we already have him in custody. What I wanna know is who’s recently paid Vanchat a lot of money. I backtrack those payments to the buyer’s account and get a record of all the purchases she’s made, maybe use it to track her down. Click there. Hello, Raina. Let’s see what you’ve been up to. Print that.
Rathman: Great. So are we done here?
Skye: One last thing.
Raina: And you’re clinging to the one thing you have… fond memories of your recovery.
Coulson: So, this person you work for told you I died and have gaps in my memory. Ever think your mind reader might just be looking up symptoms online?
Raina: I was also told it keeps you up at night, that you crave answers, that you’re troubled by the fact that when you asked for answers, you were denied. Isn’t that true?
Coulson: I trust the system. They keep secrets for a reason.
Raina: But why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you? They’re your family… Your only family since you’ve lost your mother, too. Now, after all you’ve sacrificed…
Coulson: Sacrifice is part of the job. I would give my life…
Raina: You didn’t just give your life, you gave up your chance at a normal one, at love. And she did love you, Agent Coulson.
Coulson: How could you know that?
Raina: Do you miss her? Dinners at the Richmond. Do you miss hearing her play? You didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye.
Coulson: I-I couldn’t. I-I can’t.
Raina: She cried for days after S.H.I.E.L.D. told her you died. They shattered her heart with a lie, and now they’re lying to you.
Coulson: No. No, they’re not.
Raina: I know you don’t want to believe it, but you can’t tell me nothing makes you doubt, makes you wonder what happened in Tahiti.
Coulson: It’s a magical place… I keep saying that.
Raina: Don’t you want to know why?
Coulson: Turn it… turn it on.
Simmons: The Centipede soldiers each have a port on their delivery device to inject refills of serum.
Fitz: But with this injector cuff, we can use the port to our advantage.
Simmons: By injecting a refined dose of dendrotoxin to incapacitate the soldier.
Ward: How’s it work?
Simmons: Oh, just simply lock it around the Centipede soldier’s forearm.
Fitz: And night-night, superpowers.
Ward: Sounds like riding a bull for eight seconds.
Fitz: Yeah, exactly. It’s that simple.
Simmons: Yeah.
Skye: Hello? Simmons, it’s me.
Simmons: Why, hello… Dr. Nugent.
Skye: Is someone there? God, don’t try to lie. You are the worst at this. Remember our safe word.
Simmons: Manscaping? Oh, I shouldn’t have said that. Um, I am right as rain. Couldn’t be better, old chap.
May: You three, out.
Skye: Listen up. I may have a lead on where Centipede’s holding Coulson.
May: Skye? What have you found?
Hand: We’re about to launch a major assault on a Centipede lab, and you want to take your team to the desert based on a hunch from Skye?
Ward: It’s not a hunch.
Fitz: Skye followed the money from Vanchat back to Centipede.
Simmons: Turns out they recently purchased a small development less than 100 miles from here.
Hand: Well, that’s great news for their real-estate portfolio, but we have confirmed activity at the lab. I’m taking a strike team to investigate. End of story.
May: So we split up. You take the strike team and go after Centipede. We’ll investigate Skye’s lead, see if Coulson’s there.
Hand: You backed my decision to kick Skye off the plane.
May: Seems like it worked out.
Hand: Seems like you played me.
Ward: Look, this isn’t personal, but I am taking my team and we’re gonna find Coulson. Send backup if you want.
Coulson: What makes you so sure this machine will even work?
Raina: It worked on me.
Coulson: One thing before we start… what is it with the flowers?
Raina: Who doesn’t like flowers? I’m glad you noticed. Close your eyes and relax. I want you to think back to your first memory after you died. What do you see?
Coulson: Sandy beach, blue waves… just as I remember it.
Raina: Focus on the details.
Karine: Can you feel that?
Coulson: Don’t stop.
Streiten: Listen to him! Who ordered this?
Coulson: W-what?
Karine: Director Fury himself.
Skye: Got creepy?
Centipede Soldier: You shouldn’t be here. There’s nowhere to run!
Raina: Agent Coulson, something’s happening, isn’t it?
Streiten: Listen to him.
Raina: I need you to look at your surroundings. Try and describe what you see. Are you still in Tahiti? Tell me.
Coulson: It’s dark. There’s nothing. Everything is dark.
Skye: Coulson’s gotta be here somewhere. We need to split up.
Simmons: Or run.
Ward: I’ll take care of him.
May: Are you sure?
Ward: I got this.
May: Come on, let’s move!
Skye: Coulson!
Ward: Now, Coulson, where the hell are you?
Goodman: He’s drifting. He’s drifting.
Streiten: This is wrong.
Goodman: Can you feel that?
Coulson: Don’t.
Streiten: Listen to him.
Coulson: Stop.
Streiten: Who ordered this?
Goodman: Director Fury himself.
Streiten: This is wrong! Listen to him!
Coulson: Let me die, please. Please, please. Please, I’m begging you, let me die. Please. Please let me die. Let me die, please! Please! Let me die! Please! Let me die!
Raina: Stop fighting it, Agent Coulson. Stop fighting it.
Coulson: Please let me die.
Raina: It’s for his own good.
Coulson: Please, let me die! Please, let me die! Please, let me die! Let me die. Let me die.
Skye: Coulson, Coulson. Come back, come back, come back, come back… Come back, come back.
Coulson: Skye. Skye. Skye.
May: Nice jacket.
Simmons: Bet there aren’t any flowered dresses where she’s going.
Fitz: Amen to that, sister.
Hand: Dismissed.
Agent: Let’s go, madam.
Hand: Just got off the phone with headquarters. Director Fury was very relieved.
Coulson: I understand you’ve been busy. Heard you put some miles on my plane.
Hand: The manhunt has yielded some impressive results. Centipede operations have been taken down around the globe.
Coulson: Any word on the Clairvoyant?
Hand: Nothing yet, but it’s gonna be awfully hard to stay hidden now that the Clairvoyant’s on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s radar.
Coulson: Good, because Raina knew things about me… personal things. I want to know how.
Hand: My men and I are taking her straight to headquarters for questioning. We’ll be in touch.
Coulson: Agent Hand? Thank you… for everything.
Hand: Good to have you back. Honestly, this bus isn’t really my style.
Coulson: I just want to say… thank you. Now get back to work.
Coulson: I heard what you did for me. I think it’s time… that we remove this. Disengage bracelet.
Skye: Are you kidding me?
Coulson: Thought you’d like that.
Skye: Back in that room, did they learn anything?
Coulson: No.
Skye: Did you? I heard what you were saying.
Coulson: It wasn’t real. They were just messing with my head… but I appreciate your concern.
Coulson: Evening, Doctor.
Streiten: Agent Coulson.
Coulson: You weren’t operating on my heart. I know about Tahiti.
Streiten: I was afraid this day would come.
Coulson: Because of what I’d do?
Streiten: Because of what I’ve done. After New York, you weren’t dead for 8 seconds or 40 seconds or whatever they put in your file. You were dead for… days.
Coulson: That’s impossible.
Streiten: It should be, but Director Fury moved heaven and Earth. He had a team of scientists working around the clock using procedures that no good doctor would ever allow.
Coulson: You were there.
Streiten: Fury brought me in during the seventh operation. We kept you conscious to monitor brain activity, but you were in extreme pain. The neurological damage… it was catastrophic.
Coulson: I wanted to die.
Streiten: And we should have let you. The trauma you’d endured was… Ungodly.
Coulson: Why was that machine messing with my brain?
Streiten: After what you’d been through… we wanted to restore the man you’d once been, so we gave you a pleasant memory of a beautiful island. We didn’t want you to be that… thing.
Coulson: What did I become, Doctor? Tell me.
Streiten: You’d lost your will to live. We tried to give it back. I’m sorry, Agent Coulson. Truly, I am. If you only knew.
Mike: H-hello? Anybody there? Hello? No.
