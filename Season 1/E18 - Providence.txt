Man: Stop right there!
Raina: What are you doing here?
Ward: A gift from the Clairvoyant.
Reporter: Today, world leaders are scrambling for answers after the world’s most advanced spy agency was crippled by a series of attacks. The president contends…
Agent: Sir.
Reporter: … this is the biggest intelligence leak in world history.
Coulson: Find Agent Martin. We need a back channel to the U.N., someone we trust.
Reporter: But what’s even more disturbing… the documents released from S.H.I.E.L.D. show clear evidence of human experimentation…
Skye: I made a list of S.H.I.E.L.D. bases we believe are secure.
Coulson: How many so far? Seven?
Skye: Three.
Coulson: Plus the Hub.
Skye: Including the Hub. It’s a preliminary list. I’m sure more will turn up.
Reporter: … the members of Congress are calling for investigation. But it’s still unclear who should be held accountable. Many of its leaders have vanished, leaving S.H.I.E.L.D….
Skye: You were right all along. Having all this out there in the world makes it too dangerous, and now… there’s no one left to protect it.
Coulson: There’s us. We were lucky enough to make it through. The Triskelion, the Hub… Those battles are just the beginning of this war. Hydra’s out there now, but at least our team’s still intact. We can fight them, and we will.
Ernesto (in Spanish): Welcome back, Mr. Ward. How ‘bout a shave?
Ward (in Spanish): I think I might let it grow out, Ernesto.
Raina: This is where we’re meeting the Clairvoyant?
Garrett: There’s no need to call me that anymore. Name’s John. John Garrett. Guess you were expecting more the fortune-teller type.
Raina: It’s an honor to finally meet you.
Garrett: Please, the pleasure’s all mine. You’ve done great work for us on the Centipede project.
Raina: It was your gift that showed me the way.
Garrett: Sorry, Flowers. I hate to disappoint you. I never had any gifts, at least not the kind you believed in. Just a very high level S.H.I.E.L.D. security clearance and persuasive personality.
Raina: You’re not Clairvoyant?
Garrett: Hardly. But if it’s any consolation, you weren’t alone in believing, not by a long shot.
Raina: So you’re a liar. You’re a fraud.
Garrett: An artist. A con artist, perhaps, but an artist all the same. Had to pull the wool over S.H.I.E.L.D.’s eyes somehow to do what we set out to do. Remember what that was?
Raina: To change the world.
Garrett: Why don’t you take a seat and let me show you how we’re doing that? Oh, don’t worry. I wouldn’t dream of letting Ernesto cut your hair. Welcome to Hydra.
Simmons: You need to replace the grounding wires.
Fitz: There’s no time. Ramp needs to be repaired by the end of the day. Coulson’s orders.
Simmons: What? Are they even proper orders? S.H.I.E.L.D.’s been destroyed, Fury’s dead. Aren’t they just requests?
Fitz: Well, either way, I’m in the middle of it. Stator, please.
Simmons: Well, he’s certainly not taking orders from anyone. We have no jurisdiction now that S.H.I.E.L.D.’s been labeled a terrorist organization.
Fitz: Powers that be will sort it out. All we can do is fix one thing at a time, starting with this servo drive.
Simmons: Yeah. You’re right. However, you will need to replace those grounding wires.
Fitz: It’s fine. Okay, turn on. Whoa! Whoa! Turn off!
Triplett: You need to replace the grounding wires.
Fitz: You need to shush. Shush, both of you. Hmm? Honestly, ganging up on me. Think you’re so smart? Well, why don’t you try to fix it?
Coulson: Excuse me.
Skye: Good news. The Cube has been retaken. All Hydra agents have been flushed out and are on the run.
Coulson: So that makes four.
Skye: See? I told you more would turn up.
May: The Hull’s almost completely repaired. Flight systems are back online.
Coulson: And the cargo ramp?
May: Fitz assures me that it will be operational.
Man: Sir, incoming transmission.
Talbot: This is Colonel Glenn Talbot, U.S. Air force. I need to speak with whoever’s in charge over there.
Coulson: Colonel Talbot, I’m Agent Phil Coulson. I’m happy we could…
Talbot: Mr. Coulson, It’s a real mess your boys have gotten us into.
Coulson: Hydra caught us by surprise.
Talbot: Well, that’s an understatement. It’s troubling how deeply embedded Hydra was within your ranks.
Coulson: Especially troubling for us, sir, but I assure you we’re going on the offensive. The Hub is secure. All remaining agents stand ready to assist you in whatever…
Talbot: I think we’ve had about all the assistance we can handle from S.H.I.E.L.D. I’m sending in a peacekeeping force. They’re gonna take control.
Coulson: Understood. What should I tell my men to expect?
Talbot: We just want to ask a few questions, get the lay of the land. Everything checks out, you and your boys can be on your merry.
Coulson: Sounds good. This doesn’t sound good.
Skye: He’s lying, definitely, for sure.
Coulson: If Talbot’s leading the op, there’s nothing peacekeeping about it.
May: Base defenses are operational. We could hold out.
Coulson: The last thing S.H.I.E.L.D. needs is to start a war with the U.S. Government.
Skye: What happens when Talbot gets here?
Coulson: Best-case scenario… we all get subpoenas, spend the next six months tied up in court hearings.
Skye: Worst-case scenario?
Coulson: Means they skip the subpoenas, move straight to bunker busters.
Skye: Bombs. Big bombs.
May: All the while, Hydra’s still out there.
Coulson: Get on the comms. We’re enacting Odyssey protocol.
Skye: Odyssey protocol? What does that mean?
Coulson: It means Fitz needs to finish his repairs. We’re getting the hell out of here.
May: A lot of agents are staying behind to surrender.
Coulson: Wish they’d reconsider. We need all the help we can get to fight Hydra. How’s the bus?
May: Fitz managed to jerry-rig the ramp, but the Hub’s fuel reserves were tapped out. We’re running low.
Coulson: Talbot’s landing in less than an hour. Can you get us up in the air or not?
May: Have us wheels up in 10.
Triplett: So, you guys are all set to go?
Coulson: Appreciate your help.
Triplett: Enough to give me a bunk? seeing as you guys are down a specialist, I was hoping I could hitch a ride.
Coulson: Not gonna happen. But feel free to commandeer one of Hand’s vehicles.
Triplett: I’m sorry. Is there a problem?
Coulson: No problem. Just not letting you on my plane.
Triplett: Garrett had me fooled, same as everyone else.
Coulson: Everyone else wasn’t at his side day in, day out.
Triplett: Friends of mine are dead because of him… good friends.
Simmons: I think he should come with us, sir.
Coulson: Duly noted, Agent Simmons. But this isn’t a democracy.
Simmons: Isn’t it? Under the circumstances, I think we should all have a say in this, and I witnessed Agent Triplett willing to die in defense of S.H.I.E.L.D. Respectfully, sir, I think he should come along with us.
Coulson: Okay. But Agent Triplett is your responsibility.
Coulson: We need to disappear.
Fitz: Whoa. Only S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarriers have cloaking technology.
Coulson: Then how do we avoid detection?
Fitz: We don’t. Best we can do is stay out of other aircraft’s radar and remain in flight for as long as possible. Minute we land, harder it is to hide.
Coulson: Great. How are we doing on supplies?
Simmons: We’re all stocked up on medical, but I’m afraid our food rations will only last a couple of days, at best.
Coulson: Perfect.
Triplett: Bad news.
Coulson: No kidding.
Triplett: Fuel line’s busted. We’re leaking.
Coulson: Can we fix it?
Triplett: Sure. Soon as we touch down.
Coulson: Awesome. Skye, please, tell me something good.
Skye: We have Internet.
Coulson: Yay. And, boy, have I lowered my expectations.
Skye: But all H.Q. support systems are gone.
Coulson: Well, then, the Internet it is. Find everything you can on our team… all personal records, photos, anything that proves we exist… then erase it.
Skye: Uh, that’s kind of the nuclear option.
Coulson: It’s our only option. Every government agency in the world will be on our ass. We need to vanish.
Skye: Okay. But… once that’s done, that can’t be undone. We’ll be ghosts. Not agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., just agents of… nothing. What about Ward? Have you heard from him? He and Agent Hand should have dropped Garrett off at the Fridge by now.
Coulson: Not yet. Here. Give him a call. Hearing how Garrett settled into his tiny, windowless, permanent home might actually cheer me up. When you’re finished, collect everyone’s badges. It’s no longer something we want to flash around.
Coulson: Any sign of Talbot’s forces?
May: Not yet, but we’ve only got eight hours of flight time before we have to land.
Coulson: No more than four. Fuel line’s leaking.
May: Want to tell me where we’re going?
Coulson: I don’t know.
Ward: It’s Coulson.
Garrett: By all means.
Ward: Sir. Is everything all right?
Skye: Hey, it’s me. I just wanted to let you know that Grant Ward no longer exists.
Ward: You want to explain that, Skye?
Skye: Some trigger-happy colonel threatened to pay the Hub a visit. Coulson had us evacuate before he could lock us all up. Now I’m scrubbing our I.D.S while Coulson figures out our next move.
Ward: Makes sense. Agent Hand picked up some Navy jets in the vicinity. She has us taking the long route to the Fridge just to be safe.
Skye: Wow. You took that surprisingly well. Did you hear the part about you no longer existing?
Ward: Well, it’s not the first time my identity’s been compromised. Have any idea where Coulson has us headed?
Skye: No idea. I’ll keep you posted.
Ward: Good. I’ll catch up with you when I can.
Skye: And when I see you next, who you gonna be? You got a clean slate. You can be anyone you want.
Ward: I don’t know. Maybe… Tom Brady. I always wanted to play quarterback.
Skye: And date supermodels. You are so predictable.
Ward: No, I mean the guy seems to have things pretty worked out.
Skye: Be careful.
Ward: You too.
Garrett: Tom Brady? You hate the Patriots.
Ward: The Agent Grant Ward she knows doesn’t.
Garrett: Yeah, that straight version of you is something else. I don’t even think Romanoff could pull that one.
Ward: Well, it wasn’t without its complications.
Garrett: Oh, come on. You’re not still upset about that.
Ward: Shooting Skye was not part of the plan.
Garrett: Near zero contact… that was the deal going in. Though your tip about the cellist came in handy. If you had a thing for the girl, you should have contacted me. I would have asked for your blessing.
Ward: Don’t play your games with me. This isn’t a joke.
Garrett: You don’t have to tell me. Your little candy crush was on Centipede’s tail long before she was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. Seemed like a good person to eliminate. My bad. Listen, if the job was easy, it wouldn’t…
Ward: Yeah, the job was to blend in, gather intel on Coulson’s revival. That’s it. You said yourself you didn’t want any bloodshed.
Garrett: That was before I found out Coulson didn’t know squat. You know, you would have had an easier time if I gave the kill order week one.
Ward: Yeah. But you didn’t.
Garrett: The girl I get. She’s cute. But don’t forget what the assignment was. Don’t forget who gave it to you. And don’t forget why. And cheer up! We’re close… closer than ever.
Raina: So, the equipment’s here. What do you want with me?
Garrett: Well, Flowers, I’m putting you back in charge of the Centipede project to finish phase three.
Raina: It’s Raina.
Garrett: Sorry. Force of habit.
Raina: I thought phase three ended when I couldn’t get the truth about Tahiti from Agent Coulson, When they locked me up.
Garrett: On the contrary… your little bedside chats pushed him in the direction we needed. Don’t get me wrong. We’ve had more than a few setbacks. We’ve been testing these new drugs. They all have different numbers. We thought one of them might contain whatever Jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead.
Raina: Where did you find these?
Garrett: At the facility where Fury operated on him. Coulson walked me in, hand in hand.
Raina: I’d like to see this facility.
Garrett: Unfortunately, ran into a couple of security chuckleheads who decided to hit the kill switch. I loaded my vest with as many of these vials as I could find, but none of them seem to be working quite right. There’s the look. I can see your gears turning now. I don’t have any gifts, Raina, but you do. I can’t succeed without your help.
Raina: I’ll need money. And resources.
Garrett: Your bank accounts are already fully funded.
Ward: This is a hard drive with all of Simmons’ research, both Coulson and Skye’s blood work, all the data on the guest house drug. If there’s a key to how this stuff works, you’ll find it in there.
Garrett: If you need anything else, just whistle.
Raina: Where are you going?
Ward: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s most secure facility is vulnerable right now.
Raina: The Fridge?
Garrett: Oh, you’ve heard of it. Yeah, well… we’re gonna raid it.
Skye: This wasn’t easy. Simmons got choked up when I asked for hers. This was big for me. Finally felt like I was a part of something, and now… it’s worthless. I’m sorry. I can’t imagine what this is like for you. You gave your life… literally gave your life… to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson: I was younger than you when Fury recruited me. Just out of high school. Some days, it feels like only yesterday. Other days… a lot longer.
Skye: Is that your badge?
Coulson: They look like coordinates.
Skye: Coordinates to where?
Coulson: I don’t know yet. But there’s only one person who could have sent these. And this is totally his style.
Simmons: So, Director Fury’s alive?
Fitz: What did he say? Does he have a plan?
Coulson: He only sent coordinates.
Skye: The coordinates should put us somewhere in the Canadian wilderness.
Fitz: What exactly are we looking for here, sir?
Coulson: It’s unclear. Maybe a rally point of some kind.
Simmons: Sir, have you and Agent Fury used this form of communication before?
Coulson: Never.
Simmons: Then how can you be sure that…
Coulson: Because this is how he operates.
Triplett: Could be a trap. So far, everything has been a trap. Am I wrong? Hydra could have sent you those coordinates.
Coulson: Nick Fury… Gave me this badge. When he did, I swore an oath. We all did. To serve when everything else fails, to be humanity’s last line of defense, to be the “shield.” These coordinates mean something. I’m certain of it. Fury also gave me this plane. Anyone wants off, chutes are in the bay. Help yourself.
Kaminsky: We were outnumbered, and S.H.I.E.L.D. pressed the advantage.
Garrett: You managed to make it out with the chopper.
Kaminsky: Yes, sir.
Garrett: No worries, then. The Cube’s small potatoes. Once we hit the Fridge and grab all the fun toys tucked away inside, we’ll be able to take any base we want.
Kaminsky: Hail Hydra!
Garrett: All right, all right, put your arms down, Kaminsky. You look like a West Texas cheerleader at a pep rally. Let me see that weapon.
Ward: You were disappointed that he wasn’t a real Clairvoyant.
Raina: There was a question I would have asked.
Ward: Hmm.
Raina: You’ve known him a long time?
Ward: Ever since I was a teenager. He pulled me out of a hell. Saved me from myself. So, now do you know me? You know how to work me?
Raina: I’m just curious. If I wanted to work you, I’d ask you about Coulson and his team and how you managed to gain their trust.
Ward: I jumped out of a plane. Deep-cover tactics 101… perform selfless acts of bravery early on. So I jumped to save the scientist. I had a parachute.
Raina: May never suspected.
Ward: Agent May was the primary threat, so I let things get intimate.
Raina: You don’t seem like her type.
Ward: I’m everyone’s type. Skye was the unknown variable. Being her S.O. put me in a position to be a sounding board, get an idea what she was thinking.
Raina: And Coulson? He wasn’t skeptical when you pressured him to join?
Ward: He pressured me. You’d be surprised how often you get invited to the party when you don’t want to go. “Sir, I was trained from day one as a specialist. I go in alone, I get it done. This team thing… not my speed.” I gave Coulson a person he thought he could help. Plane was full of them.
Raina: It’s that simple? You really felt nothing for them. I spent time with Coulson. He’s a good man. Someone who’d lay down his life for you. Don’t you owe a man like that something?
Ward: Sure.
Garrett: Probably gonna put a little hair on the wall.
Ward: But I owe Garrett everything.
Garrett: Yeah, it’s gonna be great. All right.
May: You okay?
Coulson: Tell you what, let’s skip the part where you act concerned about my well-being. What is it you want?
May: I need to confiscate your weapon.
Coulson: You want to share the twisted logic that makes you think that’s a possibility?
May: Fury’s dead. It’s hard to accept, and we haven’t had a chance to grieve.
Coulson: There’s no reason to. I have faith that he’s alive.
May: That feeling… this belief that he is reaching out to you, Phil, it might not be faith. It might be something else.
Coulson: And what’s that?
May: Hydra.
Coulson: Hydra?
May: Impulses implanted in your brain right alongside memories of a beautiful island.
Coulson: Really? This is what you want to come to me with right now? That’s not possible. Fury ordered the surgery.
May: Yes, but he wasn’t in charge of the Tahiti project, and the person that was behind that operation may be in ch…
Coulson: Wait, wait, wait. What did you say? Somebody else was behind it? Who the hell was that?
May: I don’t know.
Coulson: Who?! Tell me!
May: Phil, I don’t know.
Coulson: You don’t know? Oh. Let me guess. Only Fury knows.
May: Yes. And without him, there’s no way to know who is responsible. And there’s a real danger that Hydra’s controlling your actions. That’s why Fury put me on this plane… to watch you.
Coulson: I’m not gonna hand over my weapon. You want to try to take it from me? Good. Now get out of my office.
Fitz: We have to trust that Coulson knows what he’s doing.
Triplett: Hey, I respect Coulson.
Fitz: Agent Coulson to you.
Triplett: Agent Coulson. He saved our asses back at the Hub. But I’m telling you, he’s chasing the white whale.
Fitz: Okay. Have you even read “Moby dick?”
Triplett: Yeah. Have you?
Fitz: That’s not the point. Point is, stop spouting your nonsense and let me get back to checking my inventory.
Simmons: He may be right, Fitz. Coulson could be leading us into a trap and not even know it.
Triplett: The whole world’s coming apart at the seams. Now’s not the time to follow blindly.
Fitz: No. It’s times like these you stick with the guy you believe in.
Garrett: It’s a hundred floors. The only way in is through the roof.
Agent 1: Identify yourself and state your purpose.
Ward: Agent Grant Ward. You know who this is. Hand called it in.
Agent 1: We have specific orders not to let anyone in without Agent Hand’s presence. So where is she?
Ward: Where do you think she is? She’s heading to meetings with every high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent still out there. There’s a war going on, in case you guys missed it. You really want me to radio her, have her turn the plane around, come all the way back?
Agent 2: That’s exactly what you need to do.
Ward: All right. I guess you boys have never seen Hand angry, have you?
Ward: Take cover!
Agent 2: It’s Hydra!
Ward: Aah! Open the door!
Agent 2: It’s against protocol!
Ward: I don’t care about your protocol! Open the door! You’re gonna get us killed!
Agent 1: Screw it.
Agent 2: Come on!
Ward: Took you boys long enough.
Agent 1: Need to radio security. How the hell did Hydra know that you and Hand were coming?
Garrett: We told them.
Ward: A little warning next time? I mean, they had automatic weapons.
Garrett: I couldn’t resist. It was too good a line. Let’s go shopping.
Garrett: Air’s clear. First time I came down here was to lock up Johnny Horton. Ever heard of him? That guy somehow gave himself these lion’s paws for hands. Can you imagine?
Ward: That doesn’t seem practical.
Garrett: Everybody’s got their own weird thing, I suppose. Here we go. You know the Slingshot program?
Ward: Yeah, that’s how S.H.I.E.L.D. gets rid of its dangerous technology.
Garrett: Do they, now? Welcome to the toy store. All right, grab all you can, boys. If it looks dangerous, good. Alien? Even better.
Ward: It’s all here. Slingshot’s a fake.
Garrett: We shot a lot of empty rockets into space. And maybe every once in a while, they put a monkey in one for kicks. You really think Fury would give away all these goodies? We’re talking about the same guy that messed around with Tesseract technology and sparked an alien invasion. There you are. Remember this?
Ward: Yeah. I found it in Peru. Some sort of plasma particle beam.
Garrett: Plasma particle beam, my ass. I look at it more as a gold card.
Coulson: Coordinates are about a 7-mile hike from here. Terrain’s pretty rough, even if it wasn’t covered with snow.
Triplett: Agent May and I could lead a scouting party first, make sure this isn’t a trap.
Coulson: There’s no time. In less than eight hours, a NATO satellite will pass directly over us. If the bus is still here, they’ll know. I’ve been doing this long enough to know that something’s up there. But this mission has to be your choice. A lot’s changed in the last few days. I know you all have your doubts about what we’ve been doing, about me. But I don’t, which is why I’m going to find whatever Fury has waiting for us… with you or without you.
Fitz: Well, you heard the man. We don’t have much time.
Garrett: You’re welcome, gentlemen! Don’t forget to follow your dreams. Ladies. This ought to keep Coulson busy a while. Grant! Come on! We got to roll. The chopper’s almost full.
Ward: There it is.
Garrett: What the hell you doing?
Ward: You mind? You might want to take a step back.
Garrett: I’m not following.
Ward: Coulson told me there was a little something hidden down below.
Garrett: Hate to tell you, but this is the bottom floor. I’ve seen the blueprints with my own eyes.
Ward: Care to make it interesting?
Garrett: Loser buys dinner.
Ward: Perfect. I’m so sick of the crap we ate on that plane.
Garrett: Well, hello, gorgeous.
Fitz: This is not good.
Simmons: Bears. Did it find bears?
Fitz: No. Found nothing. No sign of life or S.H.I.E.L.D. base or anything making it even remotely worthwhile freezing our butts off.
Simmons: Did you mean what you said earlier, about Coulson?
Fitz: I don’t know, Jemma. I want to believe Coulson knows what he’s doing, but…
Simmons: Well, at least we still have each other.
Fitz: Yeah. Good. ‘Cause the last thing I want is for things to change.
Simmons: Fitz… it’s too late for that.
Skye: You think he’s okay?
May: It’s been a rough couple of days.
Skye: That’s not what I meant.
May: Don’t act like you know what Fury had me do.
Skye: Well, he had you spy on him for a reason. So what was it?
May: Fury was concerned about Coulson finding out the truth. The doctors felt it would have negative consequences.
Skye: Like what? Like he’d go crazy? Spontaneously combust or something?
May: It’s not clear. All I know is he seemed stable until today. And now he has us in the middle of nowhere, chasing ghosts.
Skye: That’s because his whole world fell apart.
May: He’s not alone in that.
Coulson: This is it! There’s got to be something here. Stay alert. Eyes open. It’s got to be here somewhere.
Skye: How long should we look before thinking about heading back?
Coulson: We’re not going back, not until we find whatever Fury has waiting for us.
Triplett: What about the satellite?
Coulson: It doesn’t matter. The bus used all its remaining fuel just to get us here.
Simmons: Did you know this before flying us out into the middle of nowhere?
Coulson: It was the right play. Fury sent us these coordinates for a reason.
May: And what reason is that?
Coulson: I don’t know, May! I don’t know! There’s got to be something here! This means something! This has to mean something! The world needs us! Hydra is out there! We cannot let them win. We … we cannot let them define us. Do you understand that? We are not agents of nothing! We are agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and that still carries weight! It… it has to carry weight! After everything we’ve been through, that carries weight! I’m sorry.
Coulson: Aah!
May: Get down! Get down!
Coulson: Go, go, go, go, go!
Fitz: Well, it seems like we found it!
May: Nobody move!
Simmons: I really don’t think that’s going to be a problem!
Coulson: This is a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
Triplett: Shoot first, ask questions later? Doesn’t sound like S.H.I.E.L.D. to me.
Coulson: It’s not Hydra. This is Fury reaching out.
May: There’s no way to know that for sure.
Coulson: There’s one way.
May: Phil, don’t!
Skye: Hey! No…
May: Phil!
Computer: Identify yourself.
Coulson: I’m Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Computer: Welcome, Agent Coulson. We’ve been expecting you.
Garrett: I’ve never been so happy to buy a man a steak dinner in my life.
Ward: Wait till you see the bill.
Garrett: Why the long face?
Raina: There’s a complication with the hard drive.
Garrett: I don’t like complications.
Raina: This one involves Skye. We had three teams try to hack it, but she programmed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it.
Ward: Of course she did.
Raina: In case it fell into the wrong hands, I guess.
Garrett: You know what that means, Romeo.
Skye: What is this place?
Eric: One of Fury’s secret bases. Uh, I call it Providence, although technically it doesn’t have a name because, technically, it doesn’t exist, it being a secret base and all. If everyone would follow me.
Eric: Pretty cool, huh?
Coulson: I’m sorry. Who are you, exactly?
Eric: Eric Koenig, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., level 6.
Coulson: Phil Coulson.
Eric: I know. I know. It is an honor to meet you, Agent Coulson. And I apologize for the kerfuffle outside. The precision remote system was designed to destroy any rapidly moving metallic object.
Coulson: It was my badge.
Eric: It was… Okay. That’s gonna be… Tough to replace, but very soon, you’re gonna be issued your very own lanyard. Lanyards for others will be distributed on a case-by-case basis.
Coulson: What happened to Director Fury? Is he alive?
Eric: Fury… didn’t make it out of D.C. It’s been rough. We’re all a little shaken up, especially now that the Fridge has fallen. Who is she calling?
Coulson: We had a man at the Fridge.
Skye: Ward? Oh, thank God.
Eric: Can I speak to you in private?
Eric: It’s nice having company. But don’t get me wrong. I mean, this place is great.
Coulson: What’s with the windows?
Eric: Oh, that’s supposed to make the isolation more bearable. Every day of the week, different view. Wednesday’s pretty terrific if you like topless beaches.
Coulson: So, how long have you been in here?
Eric: Since the Chitaurnvaded New York.
Coulson: Oh.
Eric: Oh, it’s not so bad. Reading a ton of historical fiction, gaming online with my brother. We’re racking up major “Call of duty” hours. You play?
Coulson: Of course. Lately, not so much.
Eric: Ah.
Coulson: So, was there something you wanted to tell me?
Eric: Yes! My bad. Fury is not dead.
Coulson: What?
Eric: Yeah, the … Hydra thinks they killed him, but he managed to escape from D.C.
Coulson: So you just lied to my team.
Eric: Well, I don’t know them. And those are Fury’s direct orders. Only a select few people can know that he’s alive… Maria Hill, Cap, a couple of others, and now you and me.
Coulson: Where is he now?
Eric: No one knows. Ever since he went dark, no one’s heard from him. This is highest priority, full Eclipse protocol. No one else can know.
Coulson: I’m not comfortable keeping secrets from my team.
Eric: Well, they haven’t been vetted. And if you talk, we’re gonna have a major problem.
Coulson: Are you threatening me?
Eric: 100%. Fury’s orders. Not big on the trust, is he? So we’re good?
Coulson: We’re good.
Eric: Great! I’m gonna get you set up with a lanyard. Uh, maybe ask Agent May to pull the plane in. I’ve got a parking space for her and everything.
Ward: All right. See you soon.
Garrett: Secret base, huh? Sounds just like Fury.
Ward: Skye confirmed. Fury’s out of the picture.
Garrett: Well, that is good news. Gives us one less thing to worry about. Listen, about the girl…
Ward: Look, I know how much it means to you. I’ll get it done.
Garrett: Hey, we all have our weaknesses. The heart wants what it wants. Can’t control everything. So, if you can do it the easy way without blowing your cover, then by all means.
Ward: I just need some time alone with her to get the information.
Garrett: You’ll have it. Coulson will be busy. I’ll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out. After that, well… cross off the team and bring the girl to me. You got your story straight?
Ward: Yeah. We just need to make it believable.
Garrett: Who are you?
Ward: Grant Ward, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Garrett: Who? Make me believe.
Ward: Grant Ward, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Computer: Identify yourself.
Ward: Grant Ward, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Computer: Welcome, Agent Ward. We’ve been expecting you.
Ward: Thought you might have given me bad directions.
Skye: At least the machine gun didn’t start shooting at you. You okay?
Ward: Oh, it’s just a scratch. Maybe a broken rib or two.
Skye: Come on. Simmons should take a look at you. Then maybe we can get that drink.
Ward: Deal.
Quinn: You. You have to be kidding me. I’ve been in a cell smaller than my shoe closet. I wasn’t allowed to eat with a fork, which would have been worse if I’d been allowed to eat anything but meatloaf!
Garrett: I did just bust you out.
Quinn: Yeah, out of a prison you put me in! Do you know what my life was like before I met you? It was really nice. But because of you, I’ve had my assets frozen, I’ve been beaten. You almost ripped my tongue out of my mouth!
Garrett: But I didn’t. I’m regretting that now.
Quinn: Yeah. And all that for a fake. Raina here, she told me the truth about “the Clairvoyant.”
Raina: He didn’t respond well.
Quinn: Hey, I bought it. That’s on me. But you’re crazy if you think I’m gonna do another damn thing for you.
Garrett: You didn’t tell him?
Raina: Didn’t want to spoil the surprise.
Garrett: It’s true I’m not gifted, Quinn. But that doesn’t mean I don’t have a special gift just for you.
Quinn: My gravitonium.
Garrett: That’s all you’ve got to say?
Quinn: Thank you.
Garrett: That’s more like it.
