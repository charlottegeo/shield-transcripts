Garrett: Grant Ward? My name’s John Garrett. The quartermaster at your military school’s an old Buddy of mine. He told me about a pissed-off young cadet with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination who went awol, stole a car, drove over a thousand miles home only to try and burn the place down. I must say, I find a young man like that intriguing. I’m curious. Did you know your brother was in the house when you set it on fire?
Ward: No, sir, I did not.
Garrett: I was a pyro as a kid, too. Ended up making a pretty good living at it. I’m here to make you a one-time offer, so listen up. Your family’s lawyer’s gonna be here in about 20 minutes. Not only are your folks pressing charges against you for arson and attempted murder, but your older brother’s petitioning the court to have you tried as an adult. Now, you can spend the next few years locked up in a cage, blaming mommy and daddy and mean older brother for your problems, or… you can let me get you out of here and teach you how to be a man. I work for a secret organization that’s always looking to recruit young men like you.
Ward: And why should I trust you?
Garrett: You shouldn’t. Don’t trust anybody, ever, especially me. Let me be clear, going with me will be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. But on the other hand, no one will ever screw with you again. Say yes. It’ll be hard but fun. 10 seconds, and I walk out that door. Say yes.
Ward: Yes.
Man: Everybody down! On the ground! Nobody move!
Garrett: I told you it was gonna be fun.
Reporter: Eyewitnesses claim the assailant smashed through several walls before killing Colombia’s most notorious drug lord, Alejandro Castillo, A.K.A. El Dogo. Speculation continues as to whether this superhuman assassination was carried out by a man, monster, or machine.
Fitz: The correct answer is “d,” all of the above. What the hell is Deathlok doing in Bogota?
Simmons: And why would he kill a drug lord with known ties to Hydra?
Skye: Well, if they really are in Colombia, then Garrett and our hijacked plane might not be in American airspace. I have to expand our search.
Coulson: Guys… you want to come in here for a minute? This is just about everything we’ve been dealing with. And this… connects them all. Cybertek built Deathlok, shipped items to Quinn, who was working for the Clairvoyant, who turned out to be Garrett, who planted Ward on our bus because he wanted to know why I didn’t stay dead. Should have drawn another chart for this part.
Fitz: No, I get it. Garrett’s been developing Centipede serum all this time.
Coulson: Yes.
Simmons: And he wants GH-325 as its final ingredient… a way to stabilize and regenerate his Centipede soldiers.
May: And it’s why Ward came back for the hard drive. It had all of your research about Coulson and Skye. It’s all on there.
Coulson: But that’s not the only thing on there. Skye left them a little surprise.
Skye: A trojan horse. It’s been slowly mapping every system they’ve uploaded it to.
Fitz: Well, that’s brilliant.
Simmons: Trojan horse.
Fitz: You can wake it up and take over their systems.
Simmons: Well done, Skye.
Skye: Yeah. Thanks. Except it doesn’t work that way because I didn’t have enough time to build it, so we need to plug this into one of their computers to activate it. Spoiler alert… we can’t seem to find one.
May: I think we have. Garrett and Cybertek have been working together for years. If it’s on Garrett’s system…
Skye: It’s on Cybertek’s.
May: Which is why we’re gonna go into one of their offices.
Coulson: We have no authority to do this. We’re no longer S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. We’re…
Fitz: We’re vigilantes.
Coulson: I was gonna say, “doing this because it’s the right thing to do,” but… yeah. So, if you’re with me, I’m gonna finish what I started. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let Garrett and Ward get away with murder. And I want my plane back.
Ward: I could have crossed off that drug lord without getting my picture taken. Single shot, half a mile away.
Garrett: You’re missing the point. I didn’t want to just cross him off. I wanted to make a spectacle. People are killed by guns every day in Bogota. But how often does a monster punch a drug lord’s head clean off? Hell, that’s international news. Spectacular thing you did back there, Mikey. If I didn’t know better, I’d swear you’re starting to enjoy your job. You get the impression he’s enjoying his job?
Ward: Somebody does.
Garrett: Well, I’d like to think we all enjoy our work. And why not? These are exciting times full of rewards. Which reminds me… Zeller. Yeah, it’s me. Stream Mike Peterson some video of his son this afternoon. Don’t mention it. How about that guy? I’ve turned him into a new man.
Ward: Is that what he is?
Garrett: Are you still sore about what he did to you?
Ward: No, I’m sore at you for making him do it.
Garrett: Look, we’re on the verge of completing something I’ve been chasing for 25 years. Can’t you just be happy for me? See? That’s what I’m talking about. Happy campers.
Raina: I think you’ll be happy, too. We’re close to replicating the drug that healed Skye and brought Coulson back to life. And the data from Skye’s hard drive, all that research… it’s been a big help. I’ve uploaded everything to the lab in Cuba. They’ll have initial results by the time we land.
Garrett: You never disappoint, do you, Flowers? Wish everyone on my team had the same success rate.
Coulson: Okay. We’ll see you this afternoon. We’re on with the R&D department up at Cybertek’s Palo Alto offices.
Skye: It’ll be okay, Fitz. No matter how deep they dig, they’ll only find the new identities I’ve created.
Fitz: It’s not that. It’s the idea of giving them access to all of our designs.
Coulson: We’re not actually giving them anything. We just need to get inside so we can plug Skye’s flash drive into one of their computers. You don’t have to go.
Fitz: It’s not that, either. It’s Ward. What if Garrett put an exploding eye into him, to control him? Maybe that’s why he betrayed us.
Skye: I’m pretty sure there’s a much simpler reason. He’s evil.
Fitz: Well, I don’t believe that people are born evil. Something must have happened.
Triplett: Hey, sorry it took so long. My mom’s real sentimental about granddad’s Howling Commando stuff.
Coulson: Trip was generous enough to offer up some of his granddad’s spy tech to help us out, so we should systematically take a full inventory of ev… Oh, my god. Is that a handheld hypno-beam?
Triplett: One of the original betas. See how it has the switch on the bottom?
Coulson: The production models moved it to the side. This is amazing! Almost as cool as a… transistorized blast gun.
Triplett: Transistorized blast gun.
Skye: Ah, ha ha. Okay. The two of you can get a room later, but we have a plane to catch.
Coulson: No.
Skye: Where did they buy this stuff, from the back of a comic book?
Triplett: Come on, girl, that’s not really a joy buzzer. That’s a… E.M.P. Knocks power out in about a 10-foot radius.
Fitz: Yeah. A lot of vintage S.H.I.E.L.D. spy craft was designed to look innocent in case a spy was caught. Like, um… Okay. Like these smokes. Oh.
Coulson: Thanks, Trip. This is a huge help. Gives us a fighting chance against these bad guys.
Simmons: Oh, Fitz.
May: Watch out, Hydra. Here we come.
Garrett: I’m gonna retire out here one day. A thousand acres of Wyoming woods and meadows, already paid for. Speak up, son. I’m not a mind reader.
Ward: What if the police find us?
Garrett: Nobody’s looking. Family will be happy to never see you again. As for cops, well… they do best when they stay out of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s way.
Ward: So, is S.H.I.E.L.D. academy near here?
Garrett: Right now, you have more pressing issues, like what you’re gonna eat tonight.
Ward: I-I thought that was our dinner.
Garrett: No, this is my dinner. I shot them, I eat them. Hell, Buddy deserves these birds more than you do. He retrieved them. Out here, son, if you want something, you have to earn it. For here on out, you earn everything. You want a warm place to sleep, you make it. You want something to eat, you kill it.
Ward: Wait, wait. Y-you can’t be serious. All… all I have in here are some clothes. Right? This isn’t fair. If you’d have told me, I-I’d have brought tools or food…
Garrett: Stop blaming me for your own failure! Makes me not like you. You want it easy? Go back to juvie. They’ll give you three squares and a cot. Confirm what your family believes, what everybody believes… that Grant Ward is weak and worthless. I’ll tell you what… I’ll leave Buddy here. You take care of him, maybe he’ll take care of you. I’ll be back in a couple of months. Either you’ll be here or you won’t. It’s up to you. But for what it’s worth… I believe you can do it.
Ott: Hi. Welcome to Cybertek. Sit. Please. I’m Ott, senior V.P. of R&D. This is Diaz.
Coulson: I’m Theo Tittle. This is Dr. Roum. Thanks so much for seeing us on such short notice.
Ott: We’ve met with a number of other former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists recently, and I must say, thus far, we’re… underwhelmed. Hydra, on the other hand, less constrained in their thinking. And younger.
Diaz: Usually younger.
Ott: Yeah.
Fitz: I told you we should have gone in.
Simmons: Oh, hush. May looks barely a day over… 30. You’re gorgeous.
Skye: Score one for the Howling Commandos. Your grandpa’s pin should help me locate Cybertek’s mainframe.
Triplett: I didn’t know they had wi-fi back in the day.
Skye: They didn’t. That’s the beauty of the pin. It uses UHF to search for data. Nobody’s even scanning those frequencies for potential leaks. That’s weird. I’m not finding any digital data about anything, let alone a source for it. How is that possible?
Triplett: Maybe it’s protected. Or… insulated somewhere inside?
Skye: Guys, just keep them busy a minute longer.
Fitz: Okay, now, show them the icer bullet. I designed this to be powerful…
Coulson: I designed this to be powerful, nonlethal, and to break… break up under subcutaneous tissue.
Simmons: And my challenge was that it could only hold a dose of…
May: 85 micrograms of dendrotoxin. He should have run the specs by me before building the molds.
Simmons: But I think we can all agree that the…
May: that the true beauty is in my hyperconcentrated…
Simmons: … dendrotoxin formula…
Fitz: … my cartridge-case…
Coulson: …cartridge-case ejection system, obviously.
Coulson: …concentrated dendrotoxin formula with compressed air expulsion.
Ott: We’ve seen one of these bullets before. What did they use it with?
Diaz: The sleepy-sleep gun, I think.
Ott: That’s right. Our team took this rudimentary concept and converted it into an aerosol grenade. Much more useful.
Fitz: But this is an icer!
Coulson: Yes, but this is an icer. Triple the stopping power and a much cooler… name.
Ott: What else do you have?
Skye: Here we go. Building permits Cybertek’s filed in the city. There’s something funky about the fourth floor. Only one way in or out. Extra-reinforced security door.
Triplett: That’s got to be it, right?
Skye: Coulson, May, can you get to the fourth floor?
Coulson: It’s a shame it didn’t work out.
Ott: It is.
May: So lovely meeting you both.
May: Does your sweater itch?
Coulson: A little bit.
Coulson: I don’t know if I’ve said it enough, but… I’m glad you’re back.
May: Try not to set the drapes on fire.
Coulson: Skye, I think I know why you couldn’t find the mainframe. There isn’t one.
Skye: What do you mean there isn’t one?
Coulson: All the files are hard copies.
May: That’s why granny was typing during our meeting. Well, we’re here. Might as well look around.
Raina: You’re staring at me again.
Mike: You gave them my son. All I see are pictures of him in a cell.
Raina: I was following orders. Just like you.
Mike: So, is someone playing god with you, too? Seeing everything you see? Waiting to push a button and blow a hole in your skull if you disobey? Is there?
Raina: No.
Mike: Then why are you here?
Raina: For you and others like you… people with gifts. I’m waiting for what’s inside to be revealed. The girl, Skye… what do you know about her? Where does she come from?
Mike: Why do you care?
Raina: Because inside, I believe she and I have something in common.
May: Hey, Coulson. Mike Peterson’s file.
Coulson: How can this all be project Deathlok? 1990? How far back does this thing go? Garrett was the first Deathlok. Let’s go. Skye, Trip, get ready for a large file transfer.
Skye: How large?
Triplett: Back it up!
Ward: You were gonna let me die!
Garrett: Okay. First off, I think we should use our indoor voices.
Ward: Since the day we met, I have done everything you asked.
Garrett: Not sure we can say “everything.”
Ward: You were gonna let Deathlok kill me to get that hard drive?
Garrett: Come on. We both know the girl wasn’t gonna let you die. You said yourself Skye’s a soft touch, just like you.
Ward: I am not that scared kid anymore.
Garrett: Then stop acting like it! Stop being weak. All these years, and you’re still playing the victim. Sometimes I ask myself why I ever bothered.
Ward: John! John! Everybody out! Now! Yeah. Here we go. That’s it. I said, “get the hell out!”
Man: You heard the man!
Ward: Alright. Hang in there. I’ll get you stabilized.
Coulson: Garrett started project Deathlok way back in 1990. Look at this. He was patient zero.
Skye: We’ve been looking at all this backwards. Garrett doesn’t just want GH-325 for his Centipede soldiers. He wants it for himself so he can become a real, live boy again. And if he happens to create an army of programmed super soldiers for Hydra along the way, triple bonus points.
Fitz: How do we know Garrett didn’t do that to Ward, too? Maybe he’s been programmed.
Simmons: Fitz, when are you going to stop clinging to the idea that Ward’s the victim and not the perpetrator?
Fitz: When I see something that tells me I shouldn’t with my own two eyes. We don’t know all the facts.
Skye: You want a fact, Fitz? Ward murders people. I should have let Mike finish him when I had the chance. I’m stupid and… weak.
Coulson: You weren’t weak. You had compassion. That’s harder. We’ll find him.
Man: Pizza delivery for Pablo Jimenez?
Coulson: That’s me.
Ward: Biomechanics rebooting. There. That should do it. You scared me. Hasn’t happened like that in awhile.
Garrett: Yes, it has. Been happening more and more. The biomechanics are fine. It’s my organs that are failing.
Ward: What are you saying, John?
Garrett: I’m dying. Cybertek team gives me a month, two tops.
May: You never came out to eat.
Skye: Not much of an appetite.
May: Look… Fitz can’t process the truth about Ward, not yet. What he said… it’s what he needs to believe.
Skye: Do you think Ward’s being controlled?
May: Absolutely not.
Skye: Neither do I. You know, I never gave you enough credit for this whole Zen-warrior thing. But I got to admit, it’d be nice to feel nothing right now.
May: You think I don’t feel anything?
Skye: Look at you. You’re a statue. And you and Ward had a thing. So if anyone should be furious…
May: I am. I’m furious. But I’m sure as hell not gonna waste it on a tantrum. I’m gonna mine it, save it… and when we find Ward, I’m gonna use every bit of it to take him down.
Skye: Wish I knew how to use that hate-fu.
May: I’m up most mornings at 5:00.
Coulson: Trip I.D.’d a number of Cybertek shipments that ping-ponged across the globe… Brazil, Cambodia, Syria… but they all ended up in Havana.
May: S.H.I.E.L.D. used to have a base there.
Coulson: I told you we’d find him. We’re going to Cuba.
Quinn: 5 bucks. That’s it, huh?
Ernesto: Sí.
Quinn: Same thing cost me $30 in Rome.
Garrett: There it is… the face of our future. Mr. Quinn’s the poster boy for our new enterprise.
Ward: Not sure how that’s supposed to work. He’s also an international fugitive, accused of a laundry list of crimes.
Quinn: Accused by S.H.I.E.L.D., of whom I’ve been a vocal critic for years. Now S.H.I.E.L.D.’s gone down in flames while I rise from the ashes, all charges dismissed and my sterling reputation restored.
Garrett: I knew there was a reason I didn’t rip out that silver tongue of yours. Everything on schedule?
Quinn: Your flamboyant display in Bogota got a lot of people’s attention. I’ll be in D.C. tomorrow, capitalizing on it.
Garrett: Good.
Ward: It’s Raina. Maybe she has news.
Garrett: Okay, Ernesto, let’s show them what handsome really looks like.
Ward: Everything okay?
Raina: Everything’s fine.
Ward: You have a problem with the drug?
Raina: This isn’t about the drug. I thought agent Garrett shared my interest in special people, in transformation. But now I realize he was just afraid to die. So I’m not sure how interested he’ll be in what I found out about Skye.
Ward: Skye?
Raina: I probably shouldn’t be talking to you about this. I should go straight to Garrett.
Ward: Garrett’s got more important things to worry about. You can tell me instead.
Raina: I’ve been looking through the files that Skye downloaded from the plane. And in addition to medical records, I found hospital files, adoption-agency searches.
Ward: Skye’s an orphan. Been looking for her parents for awhile. It’s not exactly a secret.
Raina: But that’s what intrigued me. That and her DNA. It appears to be a match for someone I heard about a long time ago.
Ward: You know something about Skye’s history?
Raina: I can’t confirm it’s her, but I did hear a story about a baby girl. Years ago, a village in the Hunan province in China. It was destroyed, every man, woman, and child torn apart by monsters trying to find that baby.
Ward: Did the monsters kill the baby’s parents?
Raina: No. That’s what’s so interesting. The baby’s parents were the monsters.
Ward: Give me one reason not to blow your head off.
Garrett: I brought tacos. I was half expecting you to be long gone.
Ward: I was half expecting you to never come back. You said a couple of months. It’s been six!
Garrett: Been out of the country on assignment. Seems like you and Buddy did okay without me.
Ward: First few weeks were rough. But then I realized my thinking was limited. So I started raiding cabins. Got some tools, the tent. Life got easier. Gonna build a cabin, over there.
Garrett: See? I told you you could do it. Damn, son, you stepped up in a big way. I couldn’t be prouder if you were my own. I lied about the tacos.
Ward: What’s that for?
Garrett: Your next lesson. Your turn. Stick with me, kid. In a couple years, you’ll shoot better than that.
Garrett: Something about that woman unnerves me.
Ward: It’s those eyes.
Garrett: No, it’s what’s behind those eyes. What did she text you about earlier?
Ward: She had questions about your decision to pack up the lab and move it to the States.
Garrett: I planned to expand operations anyway. The fact that the Deathlok files were stolen from Cybertek just speeds up my decision.
Raina: I heard you wanted to hang on to this during the flight.
Garrett: You heard right.
Ward: You’ve re-created GH-325.
Raina: Almost. We’ve distilled the genetic components of all the previous samples down to one single vial.
Garrett: And it’ll do what we talked about?
Raina: It should regenerate and heal cells, just like it did in Skye and Coulson. So take good care of it. That’s the only one in the world.
Triplett: You sure you don’t want anything else? How about one of these quarter walkie-talkies? They have a built-in homing beacon.
Fitz: Okay.
Triplett: I’ll keep one, too.
Fitz: Thanks.
Triplett: Mm-hmm.
Fitz: Don’t want to be greedy. We’ve already got the dwarfs.
Triplett: No problem. All right.
Coulson: Because we had to fly in low, we have to search for our plane on the ground. Fitz, Simmons, you have the maps. Do not engage under any circumstances. If you find the bus, call us and stand down or come back here and wait.
Simmons: We’ll be careful.
Fitz: Understood, sir.
Coulson: Let’s do it.
Coulson: We’re too late. They’re gone.
May: They knew we were coming.
Skye: I’m not sure everyone’s gone. Something’s generating a lot of volts in there.
Coulson: Yeah?
Simmons: Sir, we found the bus. It’s on an airfield outside abel Santamaria packing up to leave.
Coulson: We’re on our way. How far is that from our location?
Simmons: About three hours, but by the looks of it, they’ll be long gone by the time you can get here, sir.
Coulson: Get out of there right now. Do not engage. Wait for us back at the jump jet.
Simmons: Copy that, sir.
Coulson: Garrett’s leaving.
May: We have to at least try and get over there.
Skye: Or not. We still have this little puppy. If there’s a computer system in that barber shop, we don’t have to chase him anymore. We just plug it in, we wake up the trojan horse, and we’re off to the races.
Triplett: Worth a shot.
Coulson: Let’s do it.
Simmons: I know we’re not supposed to engage. But if they get away, we’ll be back to square one. I can’t handle square one again.
Fitz: Garrett’s there, which means Ward’s probably there, too.
Simmons: What if we send a dwarf into the plane from here? It can stow away inside so we can track where the bus is going.
Fitz: Yes. Simmons, excellent suggestion. We can send sleepy. He’s our best listener… next to you, of course. Okay. I’ll go get him from the car.
Ward: Long time, no see.
Garrett: You know he’s not human, right?
Ward: Of course I know. No, he’s better than human. Smart, loyal, trustworthy.
Garrett: Yeah. Where does all that trust and loyalty lead? Abandoned in the woods or dumped at the pound? I learned that lesson the hard way. I know you’ve never asked, but I’m sure you’re curious. Nickel version? I got fragged by an I.E.D. outside of Sarajevo. When I radioed for medevac, I got nothing but an earful of excuses. That’s when I realized I was more loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. than S.H.I.E.L.D. was to me. So I decided if I made it out, if I survived, I was gonna treat them the way they treated me. Then I stuffed my intestines back inside, duct-taped myself shut, and humped my way out. You remember when we first met? I told you I worked for a secret organization? Well, it’s more like I work for a secret organization inside another secret organization. You ever heard of Hydra? Huh. Hydra understands the importance of survival.
Ward: Here they are.
Fitz: This is our plane. We want it back.
Garrett: Really? Just like that, kid? Coulson probably figured out we’re using the barbershop. Call Kaminsky. He’ll know what to do. All right, let’s close up the ramp and get this bird off the ground. Tell the pilot to keep it low in a harrier mode until we’re out over the gulf.
Man: Will do.
Garrett: What’s he got there?
Fitz: One of those prank joy buzzers. Yeah. You know me… always kidding around.
Ward: What the hell was that?
Garrett: An E.M.P.
Fitz: Looks like the joke’s on you.
Ward: Garrett’s dying! Not sure this will work. Fitz shorted him out with an E.M.P. Call Cybertek. Let them know what happened. See what they can do. Get back.
Fitz: I’m glad that I did it. You hear me? You lose, we win.
Garrett: You’re dead.
Fitz: Well, no worse than you. And you don’t have to take orders from him anymore, Ward. Ward! Let him die. He deserves to die.
Ward: Get them out of here! Clear! Everybody out!
Garrett: I have some good news.
Ward: Can it wait a minute? Damn dog takes off running every time I take a shot out here. That deer’s 1,800 meters out. It’ll take him awhile to find it. I’m all ears.
Garrett: You’ve been accepted by S.H.I.E.L.D.’s operations division, effective immediately. We need to pack up.
Ward: Thank you, sir, for everything.
Garrett: Don’t do that. You don’t owe me or anybody else a thing. You earned it by yourself. It’s gonna be hard when you get there. If you’re gonna work within S.H.I.E.L.D. for Hydra, you can’t ever get attached to anyone or anything. You have to fight that weakness in you.
Ward: Yes, sir.
Garrett: Good. Now take care of Buddy, and we’ll get out of here. That’s not a weakness, is it?
Ward: No, sir.
Garrett: Good. I’ll be at the truck.
Ward: Internal battery must have fried. I’m gonna have to open it up, see if there’s a mechanical fix.
Raina: I talked to Cybertek. They’re prepping a facility in Miami.
Ward: Good.
Garrett: I need you to do something for me.
Ward: Yeah. Anything.
Garrett: Put down Fitz and Simmons.
Ward: What? No. There’s plenty of time. I won’t leave you.
Garrett: And I’m telling you to cross them off for me. That’s not a weakness, is it?
Ward: No.
Garrett: Then take care of them. I’ll take care of me. I’ve cheated death plenty of times.
Raina: I’ll stay.
May: Skye, where are the computers?
Skye: I’m working on it.
Coulson: Trip, anything in your granddad’s kit might help us out here?
Triplett: Always. Let me take a look.
Garrett: There’s a mechanical failsafe in case the electronics shut down. I’m pretty interesting inside.
Raina: That’s my Centipede serum.
Garrett: It’s the only thing that’s been keeping me alive these past few months.
Raina: Why isn’t it making you strong?
Garrett: I’m too far gone.
Raina: I’m afraid your entire system is shutting down.
Garrett: Maybe you can jump-start it… with this.
Simmons: Coulson will find us, won’t he?
Fitz: Man won’t rest until every Hydra agent is either dead or behind bars. Go! Go.
Simmons: Oh! Oh, no!
Fitz: Go, go!
Ward: Open the door, Fitz.
Fitz: Ward, please… I need to understand.
Simmons: You need to accept the truth, Fitz. He doesn’t care about us, about anything.
Fitz: No. I don’t believe that. We’re friends, aren’t we? We’ve been friends. We’ve had laughs together. I know that you’re a good person, Ward. And you can choose right now to be good. It’s a choice.
Ward: I’ve got my orders. Open up the door.
Simmons: No.
Fitz: Not a chance.
Ward: Yeah. Okay. Have it your way.
Simmons: Wait. What are you doing? Fitz.
Fitz: Okay. Wait.
Simmons: What are you doing?
Fitz: Wait.
Simmons: No, no, no.
Fitz: Okay, wait.
Simmons: Ward, just think about this.
Fitz: Wait, Ward. Ward. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Simmons: Just give it a second!
Fitz: Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay, okay! Just loo… Ward, look at me!
Simmons: Think about this!
Fitz: Ward, just turn around! Don’t do it! Don’t do it, Ward! Okay, you don’t have to do this!
Simmons: Ward!
Fitz: You don’t have to! You have a choice! Ward! Ward, look at me! I know that you care about us, Ward!
Ward: You’re right. I do. It’s a weakness.
Fitz: Ward!
Simmons: Ward!
Fitz: Waaard!
Raina: I can’t promise it’ll work. And once it’s gone, I won’t be able to make any more. This is the end of the road.
Garrett: Without it, I’m dead for sure. So… what the hell?
Raina: That’s it. The final ingredient.
Garrett: Is it done? If the job was easy…
Ward: What are you feeling?
Garrett: The universe.
Triplett: Come on. Over here. There’s something behind this wall. Okay, I got something.
Coulson: Secret door? I got this. They’re like my thing. Here we go.
Skye: Finally.
Coulson: It’s a Centipede soldier.
Quinn: Bogota was a freebie, a calling card, a demonstration of what we can do.
Jacobs: It was a circus.
Quinn: It was a single man with no support team and no extraction plan. I mean, come on. Tell me… how much did you spend to get Bin Laden? Between the ships and the choppers and the support troops, what was it? $30 million? $50 million?
Jolnes: Whatever the price, it was worth it.
Quinn: Maybe. My super soldier could have done it for a fraction of the price.
Jacobs: Is that why you’re here? Are you proposing to sell us this super soldier of yours?
Quinn: God, no. I’m proposing to sell you a thousand of them. Better, stronger, faster. Gentlemen, with the continued exposure of corrupt institutions like S.H.I.E.L.D., with the terrifying rise of Hydra, the need for reliable security is at an all-time high. Which is why we are expanding our super-soldier operations into a brand-new, state-of-the-art Cybertek facility. So, would you and your friends like a tour?
