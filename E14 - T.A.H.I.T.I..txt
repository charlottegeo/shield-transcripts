Coulson: She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
Simmons: She’s tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood. We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
Jazuat: It’s probably what kept her alive this long. We’ll do everything we can.
Simmons: Oh, dear. I’m a mess.
Coulson: No. You were great.
Jazuat: Intubate, and let’s start getting that shirt off. Okay, let’s prep her for ex-lap.
Coulson: I’m here. That’s unacceptable. I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Fitz: Why didn’t I stop her? I could have.
Simmons: As if you could stop Skye doing anything she’s set her mind to.
Fitz: I shouldn’t have let her go after Quinn by herself. What was I thinking?
Ward: It’s not your fault. She shouldn’t have been there. I’m her S.O. It’s on me.
May: The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn. He’s responsible.
Coulson: Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
Coulson: How is she?
Jazuat: Not good. The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines. We resected what we could, but… there’s been too much damage.
Coulson: So what’s next?
Jazuat: We can keep her comfortable, but you’ll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
Coulson: You’re saying there’s nothing to be done?
Jazuat: I’m saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
Coulson: We’re her family.
Jazuat: In that case, I’m very sorry.
Quinn: Finally. I was beginning to think you’d forgotten… Ohh. Wait! You can’t!
May: Why? ‘Cause you’re defenseless, like she was?
Coulson: May! May! Outside, now.
Quinn: Aah.
May: He deserves to die, not her!
Coulson: Agreed. But right now, Quinn doesn’t matter… only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
May: You heard what the doctor said.
Coulson: She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead. If they can do that, I’m betting they can save Skye.
Ward: H.Q. radioed in. They’ve ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge. Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
Coulson: No. Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Ward: Yes, sir. Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
Coulson: It’s where my file says I was treated after New York.
Ward: I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different? I know they saved you, but…
Coulson: They did a lot more than save me. It’s time you know the truth.
Simmons: That can’t be. What you’re describing… it’s medically impossible.
Coulson: Except for the fact that I’m standing here… proof that it’s not impossible. And here’s more proof… my file, describing how they brought me back… the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Fitz: Sir… it’s against the law for us to read this. Are you sure?
Coulson: I don’t care about your clearance level. I’m ordering you to read it.
Simmons: “Death and recovery report.”
Coulson: It’s only recently that director Fury gave me access to this. I’ve gone over it dozens of times. I need you to decipher the medical parts of it I didn’t understand. Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten. He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Simmons: Yes, I’m sure I’ll have quite a few.
Fitz: So, what about Tahiti?
Coulson: Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Simmons: Sir… it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
Coulson: That part of it I understood. And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely. We need to understand how.
Fitz: So we can do the same for Skye.
Coulson: That’s what I’m counting on.
Simmons: We’ll get right on it, sir. Thank you.
Ward: Hurt much?
May: I’m fine.
Ward: Coulson told me how long he was dead. But you already knew that, didn’t you? I saw Skye… in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her. I’m not sure I’d make this play… fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
May: If Coulson thinks there’s a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he’d take it. People like us… we need people like him. So, yeah, it makes sense … a lot more sense than the alternative.
Ward: You mean giving up?
May: Or killing the man responsible.
Ward: I did like seeing you go after Quinn. You don’t open the blinds like that very often.
Woman: S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango. You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297. Respond immediately.
Ward: Disobeying a direct order. We didn’t hand Quinn over for interrogation.
May: Great.
May: This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616. How do we proceed?
Woman: Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Coulson: Really? All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Ward: Three planes… a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
Coulson: If they scratched my paint, I’m gonna be pissed.
Ward: I’ll await your orders, sir.
Coulson: Garrett? What the hell are you doing here?
Garrett: Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I’m staring at, I still follow orders.
Coulson: You’re the worst at following orders.
Garrett: Maybe… but I like this one. You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge. Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson. You wouldn’t know it to look at him, but Phil’s one of our finest.
Triplett: An honor, sir.
Garrett: Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus. Go secure the prisoner.
Triplett: Yes, sir.
Garrett: Phil, come on. Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn’t mean they won’t shoot it out of the sky.
Coulson: Why are you really here, Garrett? S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn. Why you? You’ve been chasing him, too!
Garrett: Since Malta. Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
Coulson: You can’t have him, not yet.
Garrett: This isn’t a request.
Coulson: Quinn shot one of my agents. She’s on life support in a med pod downstairs. We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Garrett: Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Coulson: Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta. When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
Garrett: I never took him for a triggerman. He pays others for that. I’ve lost three of my own chasing him.
Coulson: Then you understand why I can’t give him to you until we save my agent.
Garrett: Because if she doesn’t make it…
Triplett: Agent Grant Ward.
Garrett: Trip. Is Garrett upstairs?
Triplett: Yeah. You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
Ward: It was 2,000. So, what are you doing here?
Triplett: Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
Ward: Mm.
Triplett: I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this. How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
Ward: He died.
Triplett: That’s tight. You want to point me to the box you’re keeping Quinn? H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning. Is that a full bar?
Ward: You’re welcome to it. But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Triplett: Come on, man. Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
Ward: Why don’t you remind me?
Triplett: Garrett wants Quinn. It’s my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants. Now where is he?
Ward: Can’t help you with that.
Triplett: No worries. I’ll find Quinn myself. I’m sure he’s tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Ward: Hey.
Coulson: Agent Ward, stand down. Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement. He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Garrett: Well, I’m a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be. You wouldn’t believe what I could talk this son of a gun into. Good seeing you, son.
Ward: You, too, sir. And thank you.
Garrett: Saving the girl’s top priority, and she might know something.
Simmons: I’ve never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson… GH-325? And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories? It all sounds so diabolical.
Fitz: I agree. We can’t argue with the results. He’s walking around.
Simmons: Yeah but at what cost? You read the transcripts. He begged the doctors to let him die.
Fitz: This is different. Skye’s still alive. We have to keep her that way.
Simmons: Oh. I’ve asked Dr. Streiten to advise us. Hello. Yes. Are you sure? That can’t be.
Garrett: And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Coulson: Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett. He’s here to ask you some questions.
Quinn: Oh, no, thank you. I… my head’s still ringing from the last visitor.
Garrett: At least the last visitor left you with a head. I’m not always that considerate. I’m interested in one of your newer projects.
Quinn: Hmm? Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Garrett: Let me be clear… you have no rights. You have no lawyer. The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions. Is that clear?
Quinn: Mm-hmm.
Garrett: You understand that?
Coulson: No.
Quinn: Aah. Ohh.
Garrett: Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
Coulson: Deathlok?
Garrett: Catchy, right? Sounds like some wrestler from the ‘80s. What is it really?
Quinn: Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach. So… she’s still alive?
Garrett: Yeah. And you better hope she stays that way.
Coulson: Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
Quinn: No. I shot Skye because that’s what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
May: You wanted to see me?
Simmons: I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda. Dr. Streiten’s gone off the grid.
May: So we’ll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
Fitz: That’s the thing. Actually…
Simmons: Coulson was never treated there.
May: You’re not making sense.
Simmons: None of this makes sense. The doctors listed, the operating-room number… none of them exist. None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Garrett: What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Quinn: Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
Coulson: He must have something pretty terrible on you. Shooting an unarmed girl?
Quinn: Let’s just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Garrett: Yet… here you are.
Quinn: Let me assure you it wasn’t luck that led me to your partner’s black sedan in Berlin or that he’d open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco. Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad? No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Garrett: Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
Quinn: The Clairvoyant sees everything… except what happened to him.
Coulson: This is still about me.
Garrett: Wait. You’re gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
Coulson: You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York? There’s more to it than that. I thought I was gone for seconds… turns out it was days.
Garrett: That’s impossible.
Quinn: Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
Coulson: Even order you to shoot Skye.
Garrett: Wait. You don’t know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
Coulson: That’s why we’re flying to where I was treated.
Garrett: So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
Quinn: So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
Garrett: Or you let the girl die.
May: Quinn shot Skye for nothing. The place we were going, the doctors who treated you… they don’t exist.
Coulson: Or maybe they exist somewhere else. This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
Simmons: That’s my fear, sir. Your file is filled with secrets… experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we’ve never even heard of. Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what’s in here.
May: Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there’s the other obvious question.
Coulson: Which is?
Simmons: Whether we should. What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate…
Coulson: No one’s suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there’s something in here… a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it. Figure it out.
Simmons: Yes, sir.
Coulson: You disagree.
May: No. I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye. But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
Coulson: It’s a risk we have to take.
Fitz: How is she?
Simmons: Deteriorating, and I don’t know how to stop it. The only thing I’ve found remotely interesting is something called “GH-325.”
Fitz: Some kind of drug?
Simmons: Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Fitz: Regeneration? Is that even possible?
Simmons: Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don’t know where to find it. We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone’s departure or arrival.
Fitz: I think maybe I can help with that.
Simmons: You’ve set up the echo-chamber.
Fitz: Yeah, I made a couple of calls. A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion. Agreed to let us access it from here. Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s historical administrative data.
Simmons: Yeah, but if Agent Coulson’s operation didn’t take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility…
Fitz: We won’t find any record of it here… I know. But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders. Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Simmons: Yeah. Okay. Well, let’s start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Fitz: Okay. Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten’s departure from the Triskelion? Maybe they have that.
Simmons: Yeah.
Fitz: Here. This is interesting.
Simmons: A World War II bunker?
Fitz: “Collapsed” bunker. Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
Simmons: “The Guest House?”
Fitz: Exactly. Guest House… G.H. GH-325. Look at the file’s access history.
Simmons: The only record of it being opened…
Fitz: Is by a level 10 operative.
Fitz & Simmons: Director Fury.
Simmons: So, Fury’s been to this place, and he’s the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson. And why aren’t you trying to find the file?
Simmons: Ah, damn. Encrypted. Skye could crack this.
Fitz: What would she do? It’s not an encryption.
Coulson: The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. We don’t know who or what’s in there. Be prepared for potential resistance.
Garrett: No contact from inside?
May: I’ve tried every known channel… no response.
Ward: Place could be abandoned.
Coulson: Let’s hope not. We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Fitz: Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment’s notice, sir.
Garrett: Trip can help. He’s had med-tech training.
Coulson: Good. We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
Ward: What if they don’t want to help us?
Garrett: I’ll say “pretty please.”
Coulson: We need the doctors alive and the place intact. If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye. And then we take it. Let’s move.
Alpha: Company?
Beta: Nothing’s scheduled for a couple weeks. Try the protocol.
Alpha: How was the drive from Istanbul?
Coulson: Countersign?
Garrett: No clue.
Ward: Never heard it.
Fitz: I can’t find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s protocol directives.
Coulson: This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. We don’t know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance. We know she can be treated here. Open the doors. Maybe we can work something out. Do you copy?
Alpha: How was the drive from Istanbul?
Coulson: We’re looking for medical assistance. A person’s life is at stake. Will you help us?
Alpha: How was the drive from Istanbul?
Garrett: “Pretty please” it is.
Beta: These guys are good… hacked their way in.
Alpha: How the hell did they find this place?
Beta: Doesn’t matter. Didn’t know the countersign. You want left or right?
Alpha: Left’s good.
Fitz: There’s an antechamber and a set of glass doors. Can’t see much beyond that. Lights are all out.
Coulson: Well, they know we’re coming. Let’s go say “hello.”
Ward: Clear.
Fitz: Okay, Simmons, we’re going in now. Simmons? Damn it. Comms are down. There’s too much mountain on top of us.
Garrett: Trust me… it’s better. You don’t want them hearing the horrible death we’re walking into. Humor, son. You Brits are too serious. Besides, if the job was easy…
Ward: It wouldn’t be any fun.
Fitz: I’m not afraid… not yet. I suspect the real danger won’t happen until we breach that bulletproof glass. Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
Coulson: What do you think, Fitz? Can you get us inside?
Fitz: To certain, horrible death? Absolutely. Okay, sir, just say the word.
Coulson: Once we get inside, everybody find cover. All right, gentlemen, here we go.
Coulson: We’ve come for medical assistance. But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel…
Ward: I count two hostiles.
Garrett: Copy that. Ready?
Coulson: You got one of those little flash things?
Fitz: Yeah.
Coulson: Ward!
Garrett: Clear!
Coulson: See if you can get some lights on.
Fitz: Yeah.
Garrett: No hard feelings, Bob.
Ward: Clear. We’re not done. This one’s hit. Shouldn’t be too hard to find.
Coulson: Go. We’re gonna get you medical help. Is anyone else down here? Where are the doctors?
Alpha: Med staff doesn’t stay here.
Coulson: We’re looking for a drug… GH-325. It might help you, too.
Alpha: Do I… k-know you?
Coulson: I don’t know. I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Alpha: Then you know about… the timer.
Garrett: We got a problem!
Garrett: Semtex. The whole place is rigged to blow.
Fitz: There’s enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Ward: Sir. Less than 10 minutes. It’s probably a failsafe. If the guards had eliminated us, they’d stop the timer.
Coulson: Since they didn’t…
Fitz: It’s some kind of emergency override. Skye could probably get past it, but I can’t hack the panel, which means we’re trapped in here.
Coulson: You’re the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs. Figure out a way to get us out of here. Let’s go find the drug.
Fitz: So this is some sort of medical facility.
Coulson: Yeah, but if nobody’s here, I’m not sure it’s gonna do us any good.
Triplett: Tough when it’s your team. You guys go back a ways?
Simmons: Not really. A few months. We have nothing in common… couldn’t be more different.
Triplett: But you can’t imagine your life without her.
Simmons: Yes. You’ve experienced that, Agent Triplett?
Triplett: I have. Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Simmons: Yeah.
Triplett: She’s very lucky to have you. I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you’re in my corner, too.
May: Comms are down. If I don’t hear anything within the hour, I’m going after them.
Simmons: Skye’s coding. Both of you, now.
May: How can we help?
Simmons: I need a unit of Epi.
Triplett: Got it.
Coulson: Don’t. Let me die. Please. Let me die!
Fitz: Is that where…
Coulson: Yeah.
Ward: The timer doesn’t control the explosion. It’s just a clock. Detonator must be somewhere else.
Garrett: It’s not in here, or I’d have found it. There’s no time to search the whole compound. Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Fitz: Sir, are you sure you want to? We should put suits on before we go in there.
Coulson: You’re right, but there’s no time.
Fitz: I wish I could speak to Simmons. She’d know what most of this stuff is… or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Coulson: Fitz. Oh.
Fitz: I don’t see any G.H… Agent Coulson. It’s locked.
Coulson: Here. Put these on. Got it.
Ward: Time to go. We couldn’t stop it. Four minutes and counting.
Coulson: Almost there.
Ward: There’s semtex throughout here, as well.
Fitz: This is it… 325. This is the one we want.
Coulson: We gotta go. Get it up to Simmons.
Fitz: Yeah.
Ward: Sir.
Coulson: I’ll be right behind you. Go.
Ward: Three minutes.
Garrett: Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz? Explosives are a fascinating specialty… very exacting. Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction… bury us like fossils for a thousand years. Guess we don’t have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place. Agent Ward… would you do the honors?
Ward: Thought you’d never ask.
Garrett: Can you slip through?
Fitz: Yeah
Garrett: Go. All right. Get that drug up there.
Ward: Coulson.
Garrett: Where the hell is he? Phil! Go with Fitz. Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
Ward: Agent Garrett.
Garrett: Go! Save the girl.
Simmons: Weak, erratic heart rate. Each time we save her, I ask myself, “is this what Skye would want?”
May: We didn’t come this far to quit.
Fitz: Get off… the ground immediately.
Simmons: They’re alive. Maybe we can…
May: Fitz, come in. What’s your status?
Garrett: Phil! Phil, what the hell? Clock’s not slowing down. It’s about to get really warm in here. Hey, you with me? The guys are out already. They took the drug up to Skye.
Coulson: No, don’t give it to her. The drug… they can’t give it to her!
Garrett: All right. You can tell them yourself. Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground. Now let’s go.
Fitz: We found it.
Simmons: What is it? And how much, injected where?
Ward: May, get us off the ground, or it’ll fall out from under us.
Coulson: No! Don’t give it to her!
Skye: I was losing her, anyway. What harm can it do?
Triplett: Come on, girl.
Garrett: It’s working.
May: She’s spiking.
Ward: Stop it. How can we stop it? Skye!
Coulson: What’s happening?
Simmons: I don’t know…
Coulson: Skye!
Fitz: Do something… we have to do something!
Simmons: Her heartbeat… she’s stabilizing.
Coulson: Simmons?
Ward: Could someone tell me what we just saw?
Triplett: The girl’s a fighter. What was that stuff you just gave her?
Simmons: I don’t know. All I know is that it worked.
Triplett: You’re a real miracle worker.
May: You did it.
May: Something happen down there?
Garrett: I’m not sure. One minute, he was fine. The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
Garrett: I have good news and bad news. Which would you like to hear first? Bad news, then… there’s a fair amount. Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he’d have your back… he’s a no-show. The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds… blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock. It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he’s gonna get away with murder, he’ll believe it. Trip. Girl’s gonna live… live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach. Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius. This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
Quinn: You said there was good news.
Garrett: I did? Oh, yeah. You still have your tongue.
Triplett: Let’s go.
Coulson: I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Garrett: Don’t mention it. There’s still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
Coulson: I’m counting on it.
Garrett: Something I need to ask you, Phil.
Coulson: Of course.
Garrett: We’ve known each other a long time.
Coulson: Yes, we have.
Garrett: Been in our share of tight spots together. If it had gone the other way… if Skye hadn’t survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
Coulson: You were the one who made that threat. I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
Garrett: You’re right. It was me. My mistake.
Coulson: Till next time.
Garrett: Might be sooner than you think. My man Trip’s got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
May: Do you mind? You did the impossible today. You saved Skye’s life. Why aren’t you happy about it? They told me you were yelling… to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye. Why? What made you change your mind?
May: Phil? Phil! You all right?
Coulson: Being down there… seeing where I came from… I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did. But she didn’t. For whatever reason… she didn’t.
Nicole: I’m gonna go see if they have a map.
Jimmy: I’ll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie. Are you okay?
Lorelei: No. No, I’m parched and weary. Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Jimmy: Midgard? I don’t know where that is. This is Death Valley.
Lorelei: Oh. I seek passage from this… valley of death to a more bountiful land.
Jimmy: I wish I could help, but… it’s built for two. Y-you should ask the manager inside. Uh, maybe there’s a bus later today.
Lorelei: She’s your bride?
Jimmy: Yep, since yesterday morning.
Lorelei: And you prefer her to me?
Jimmy: Well… yeah. I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone. That’s why I married her… together forever.
Lorelei: Loyalty… I admire that in a man. I am going to need your help… if I am to remain free.
Nicole: Jimmy!
Jimmy: I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don’t even know your name.
Lorelei: It’s Lorelei. My name is Lorelei.
