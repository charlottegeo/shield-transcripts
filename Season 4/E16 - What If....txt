Skye: Lincoln? Lincoln.
Ward: What? That a thing we do now? Tell me it means you’re making the coffee.
Skye: Ward. It’s, uh… Sorry. You j… You startled me.
Ward: It’s not like I snuck in here. So, what’s up?
Skye: We got called in to work.
Ward: Okay. I’ll get dressed. Weirdo. You know we’ve spent more nights out tracking Inhumans than we’ve had at home? Bosses can’t give us a morning off?
Skye: Bosses. Mm. Who do you think’s running the brief?
Ward: Well, I don’t know. You got the text. We should go there again. That was a fun trip. So, what’d they say? Skye, who texted? Skye.
Skye: Someone who knew you’d sleep in.
Ward: Pinsky. Probably another intake briefing. Don’t forget this.
Man: A kid arrested this morning, an Inhuman, of course, was grabbed feet from a public market. Just imagine what he was planning. And I have it on good authority that someone was hiding this Inhuman. I hope this subversive was strung up for treason. Unbelievable.
Ward: You’re quiet. Are we okay? Or what?
Skye: Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. I just, um… Oh, my God.
Ward: Yeah, some mornings, the Triskelion looks so beautiful.
Ward: Come on. We’re gonna be late.
Man: You can’t do this!
Man 2: Sure we can, Inhuman!
Skye: Son of a…
Ward: Hey!
Man 2: Get him up.
Ward: They can handle it on their own. Come on.
Ward: What are you doing? You’re on another planet this morning. Look, I get it. You put yourself out there last night, and I let you down. I’m sorry.
Skye: What are you apologizing for?
Ward: It’s been a few years. It makes sense to take this step. I would love to live with you. It’s just… it’s not the right time.
Skye: I asked you to move in? I, um… I mean, I did. And you’re right, it’s a bad idea.
Ward: I just need some time, some space. Skye, there are things about me that you wouldn’t like if you knew.
Skye: Trust me. I know.
Ward: Skye.
Skye: Ward.
Ward: It’s that way.
Skye: Kill me already.
Ward: Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report? Of course you did.
Skye: I’m gonna check my e-mail.
Ward: Why? Anyone who’s e-mailing you is gonna be in the briefing.
Skye: Yeah, that’s why I want to get caught up.
Ward: Okay.
Skye: “Died during testing?” What did they do? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It can’t be.
May: Can’t be what?
Skye: May. You’re here. Are you okay? Are you okay? I came looking for you.
May: Get started with the briefing.
Skye: No, no, no, May, it’s me. I… I got into the Framework.
May: I don’t care what you’ve hacked.
Skye: May, look at me. It’s me… it’s D…
May: Do I have to get you drug-tested? Get in the briefing.
Skye: Sorry. I’ll come now.
Simmons: I was murdered? Aah!
Simmons: S.H.I.E.L.D. fell. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Julia: Are you okay?
Simmons: Thank you. I need help. Please.
Julia: Okay. Yeah. Get in, get in.
Simmons: I’m Jemma.
Julia: I’m… I’m Julia. Uh, where can I take you? D.C.? Is o… is that okay?
Simmons: Yes, thank you. Anywhere but here.
Julia: Yeah.
Julia: That’s a really dangerous area. What were you doing there?
Simmons: It was dreadful. No, I’m… I’m fine. It’s complicated.
Julia: It’s okay. I didn’t… Whatever happened, I didn’t mean to push.
Simmons: Right. Yeah, well. Better we don’t. What about you? What are you into?
Julia: Me? I’m boring. I wait tables for now. But I make these. They’re kind of cool.
Simmons: You make art? Fascinating. So incredibly lifelike.
Julia: It’s nothing special. It’s just side money for med school. I always dreamed of helping people.
Simmons: You have dreams. This is all so real. So many computational layers. What’s wrong?
Julia: It’s a new Inhuman checkpoint. They take forever, but it’s worth it.
Simmons: They can test for Inhuman DNA, pre-Terrigenesis?
Julia: Don’t they do that everywhere? I mean, it freaked me out the first time, but they just check I.D.s here.
Simmons: I don’t have one. I must have lost it back there.
Julia: No, no, no. You need… You need your ID. Like, you need it.
Simmons: I’m sorry. I… I don’t… I don’t have it.
Julia: Jemma, they’re gonna arrest us.
Simmons: Well, okay. Well, okay, wait. Let’s just… Oh, here we go.
Julia: S.H.I.E.L.D.
Simmons: No.
Julia: Y-You’re one of them.
Simmons: Wait. No, no, no. Listen.
Julia: Get out.
Simmons: No, no, please.
Julia: You lied to me.
Simmons: Please, please, please.
Julia: Get out! Get out! Get out!
Simmons: I just need to find my friend Daisy. Can I use your phone?
Julia: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Please! I’m sorry! Just please close the door.
Pinsky: I warned you not to be late.
Skye: Shut up, Pinsky.
May: Let’s start. We’ve got an Inhuman gene-positive detainee, possibly linked to subversive groups. The Doctor wants this fast-tracked. Don’t disappoint him. Subject is Jason Rajan of Deanwood. We believe he’s funneling Terrigen to subversives. Look who’s perking up. You know this guy?
Skye: No.
May: Then get to know him. You and Ward take point. I want this intel at any cost.
Ward: You’re in a very precarious position, Mr. Rajan. Inhuman status isn’t a crime. But lying about it is.
Vijay: I never lied.
Ward: We’ll see about that. Hydra cares more about what you’ve done than what you are. So when my partner here asks you about smuggling charges, I highly suggest you cooperate.
Skye: Your name is Jason Rajan, born in Edison, New Jersey?
Vijay: Yes.
Skye: Did you know that you were an Inhuman before today?
Vijay: Yes.
Skye: And it says that you own an import business, but Hydra surveillance says one of your trucks is missing. Where is it?
Vijay: I don’t know. It was stolen.
Skye: Was stolen, but you didn’t file a police report.
Vijay: I’m an Inhuman. I was afraid to talk to the authorities.
Ward: What was stored in the truck, Mr. Rajan?
Vijay: I don’t know. I don’t deal directly with those kinds of shipments.
Ward: Bull. Where is the truck?
Skye: Forget about the truck. This guy’s never seen Terrigen before in his life. Hydra-issued citizen’s card. But I know for a fact that your name isn’t Jason Rajan, so I wonder, who made it?
Ward: It’s not possible.
Skye: Exactly. Unless someone within Hydra provided it. I am trying to save your life. So tell me, is there a threat within Hydra?
Vijay: You never helped anyone, you bitch! Give me the Terrigen, and I’ll show you a threat.
Ward: Someone in Hydra make this for you?
Skye: Your name is Vijay Nadeer. Don’t deny it.
Vijay: My DNA is not a crime. I’m not a criminal.
Ward: You should know…
Skye: Ward! What…
Ward: At least we broke him.
Simmons: Not one smartphone.
Woman: Hey, come on. Really?
Man: It’s not my fault.
Agent 1: Oh. Are you all right, ma'am?
Simmons: I’m great. Thank you.
Agent 1: Rough day?
Simmons: Oh, I was just hiking. I tripped. So clumsy.
Agent 2: Everything okay?
Agent 1: Oh, our, uh, friend here went hiking.
Agent 2: Oh, yeah? In a dumpster or…?
Simmons: Well, that’s not very nice. No, I fell. And I just want to get home.
Agent 1: I’ll need to see your I.D.
Simmons: Yeah. Okay. Oh. I must have lost it in the fall, I guess.
Agent 1: Hmm. Come with us, please. Let’s start with your name. Name.
Simmons: Simmons. Jemma Simmons.
Agent 1: You got that?
Agent 2: Got it.
Agent 1: You’re lying about something. I can see it.
Simmons: Based on what? My… My clothes? My accent? I told you, I lost my I.D.
Agent 2: I-It says here she’s a dead girl.
Agent 1: False identification. Big trouble.
Agent 2: But it’s her picture.
Coulson: This is a dangerous world. The Cambridge Incident proved that. To understand this, you have to imagine individuals over the state. It was a mess. People were divided. They had their own truths, their own media, their own agendas. There were so many untruths about Inhumans out there that some people saw them as these magical, heroic creatures, like unicorns. It was terrifying. Then, you had a weak state that allowed a refugee from Bahrain, a girl, sympathetic. Even though S.H.I.E.L.D. knew she was Inhuman, they brought her back to the States and put her into a classroom. The rest is history. But what inspires me is the way our country reacted, the way we came together. When no one would tell us the truth, Hydra stepped forward. They brought us law and order, purpose. They galvanized us for the good of the state over individual interests. They… Yeah, Burnell.
Burnell: But, sir, isn’t it true that Hydra came from Nazis?
Coulson: That’s not true. Never say that.
Burnell: Okay, but weren’t they the Nazis’ science division?
Coulson: Anyone who’s informed knows that Hydra originated centuries ago. So they couldn’t be Nazis. That’s just propaganda. But this is good. This shows how important it is to separate fact from innuendo. Before the incident, there were over 1,500 newspapers, some of them…
Man: Mr. Coulson? Sorry to interrupt.
Coulson: That’s alright. How can I help you?
Man: Yeah, Chris Adler.
Coulson: Chris?
Man: We’re just gonna run a few tests.
Coulson: Wait, Chris.
Chris: Yes, Mr. Coulson?
Coulson: Don’t forget your bag, son.
Man: Oh. I’ll take that.
Coulson: Okay. Let’s get back to the lesson.
Ward: You got quiet, Vijay.
Skye: It’s probably because of his broken jaw.
May: No more games.
Vijay: You’re her. I know you.
May: I doubt it.
Vijay: All Inhumans know you. Bahrain. It’s funny, ‘cause the world blames Inhumans for what happened. But it was you that got it wrong.
Skye: May! May, don’t do this. This isn’t you. May, wake up! He’s valuable to us.
May: Take him upstairs for testing.
Skye: Yes, ma'am. The Doctor will get answers.
Vijay: No. Just… Not him. No! No!
Skye: Come on!
Vijay: No! Not the Doctor, okay? I-I’ll talk! All right, you’re right! All right? The I.D. was real.
Skye: Shut up, shut up, shut up. What did you mean when you were talking to Agent May? The Bahrain op was a success.
Vijay: God, you have a sick measure of success.
Skye: I’m sorry if she killed an Inhuman child, but if it saved everyone else…
Vijay: If that girl had been taken down in Bahrain, she wouldn’t have gone on to kill all those people in Cambridge. Thanks to your friend back there, Hydra has a green light to exterminate Inhumans.
Skye: Okay. Listen, I know you don’t trust me, but I can help you get out of here.
Vijay: Oh, really? You should avoid saying that under the cameras.
Skye: Ohh! Aah! Vijay! Vijay!
Agent: We have him, Doctor.
Skye: Fitz.
The Doctor: You lost control of your prisoner.
Skye: I would’ve caught him.
The Doctor: Follow me.
Simmons: Thank goodness. Oh. Come on, Daisy. Come on.
Simmons: There you are, sir. I’m coming.
Simmons: Coulson.
Coulson: Yes?
Simmons: It’s so, so good to see you, sir.
Coulson: I’m sorry. Have we met? Are you…? Please don’t say you were a student.
Simmons: You don’t remember me, do you? Uh, I’m Jemma. It’s Jemma. Jemma Simmons, sir. It’s been such a horrible day, and when I saw where you were, I hoped that you…
Coulson: Horrible? Did something happen? Should I call someone?
Simmons: No, please don’t call anyone. I-I just need to talk to you.
Coulson: I don’t understand. W-When did you say we met?
Simmons: In the real world. Before you were ever a teacher.
Coulson: Unless you count summers lifeguarding, I’ve always been a teacher.
Simmons: You see, you think that. You think that you were, but no. It’s… Oh, there’s no sane way to say it, so… Do you have moments where reality isn’t quite right? Like y-your memories don’t fit?
Coulson: Who are you?
Simmons: Simmons. I know I sound like a lunatic, but you have had your mind wiped and implanted with false memories.
Coulson: Okay. It’s time to leave.
Simmons: No, please, you… you need to hear this. I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. You were the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. You destroyed Hydra. And now you’re… you’re… you’re trapped in a virtual prison, and I am here to wake you up.
Coulson: Put that away before we both get arrested. What is this? Is this a test? Because it’s not gonna work. I’m loyal to Hydra. I’m just a teacher.
Simmons: Yes, you are a teacher! You… You are a teacher, and a… and a… and a leader and… Oh, y-you’re a great man, and you shouldn’t be here! I have no way to prove it. Not yet. I need to… I need to go back…
Coulson: Please, get yourself some help. And whatever you do, don’t talk about S.H.I.E.L.D.
Simmons: TAHITI.
Coulson: No. No, that’s Hawaiian.
Simmons: Remember Tahiti. It’s a magical place.
Coulson: Why did you say that?
Simmons: It’s a magical place. This isn’t an accident. Your memory’s been rewritten before! You are Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and your subconscious knows that!
Coulson: You need to go.
Simmons: You need to remember me! And Fitz and Agent May and all the good that we have done! Your friends depend on you, and this world is a lie!
Coulson: I have tried to be nice to you, but that’s enough! I don’t know you. Now leave.
Simmons: Okay. I’ll go. But I am not giving up on you, sir.
Coulson: Yes, I’d like to report a subversive.
Simmons: Hey! What are you doing? You tagged my car. I can’t drive this now.
Burnell: I didn’t tag it.
Simmons: You’re holding the can.
Burnell: What can? I… I mean, that’s how Hydra does it, right? You and Mr. Coulson, I mean, y'all lie to us every day. You know, th-that Hydra isn’t a bunch of Nazis, and… and that you don’t steal kids out of school?
Simmons: You think I’m Hydra.
Burnell: I saw you talking to Coulson! Where’s Chris? You know, go ahead. Take me to him. ‘Cause if not, I’m gonna find the Resistance and come after all of you.
Simmons: I don’t ha… Ah. You’re not even real, you rogue piece of code! This is… This is all fake! It’s a virtual world. I don’t mean that. Look at me. Do I look like I’m Hydra?
Burnell: You look like a bag lady.
Simmons: I’m Jemma. Coulson let Hydra take your friend? Damn. You know, Coulson used to fight Hydra. He was as brave as you and got into more trouble and even trained me well enough to steal this car.
Burnell: Coulson? You’re crazy. Look, I mean, they’re definitely gonna stop you now.
Simmons: Well, have at it. And for the record, Hydra? They’re all Nazis.
Burnell: Hey. Look, I trashed your car. You can borrow mine.
Simmons: You’re sure?
Burnell: Are Hydra all Nazis?
Simmons: Every last one of them. And don’t you let anyone forget it.
The Doctor: Now, with this machine, we can test Inhuman powers without any side effects.
Skye: It seems like it’s burning him. There are side effects.
The Doctor: Well, yes. I meant, we can determine their powers without permanently triggering Terrigenesis in the subject. We’ll change the world.
Skye: Fitz, this is wrong. This… this is crimes-against-humanity wrong.
The Doctor: These are Inhumans. You’ve been a great asset, Skye, but unless I ask for your opinion, don’t give it. How are things going with Grant Ward?
Skye: They’re good.
The Doctor: I noticed your application for co-habitation had been approved.
Skye: Yes.
May: Sir, there’s a report you need to see. Subversive activity at a school, a woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.
The Doctor: Really?
May: The report was called in by a teacher, Phillip Coulson.
The Doctor: Who’s the girl?
May: Suspect was in her mid 20s, British.
Skye: Did you get her name? Where was this?
The Doctor: You can go. I want any and all assets in the area on this.
Ward: Hey. What’s up? We get a call?
Skye: No, I just have some stuff to do.
Ward: Stuff. Really? Skye, you never leave early. You’ve been pissed at me all morning. Your attitude at work here sucks. It’s like I woke up to a totally different person.
Skye: You know what? You’re right. I’m pissed. I tried to get closer to you in our relationship, and you shut me down because you said you needed space. Fine. Take all the space you need, but right now, I need my own.
Coulson: It’s a magical place.
Skye: No.
Simmons: Daisy!
Skye: Jemma!
Simmons: Oh, I was so worried. Wait. You’re Hydra?
Skye: It’s a long story. I saw that you were dead. Wait. Are you still dead?
Simmons: No, I’m feeling much better.
Skye: So you’re okay.
Simmons: Yeah.
Skye: You were supposed to be buried in the U.K.
Simmons: More like a mass grave at the Academy. The story’s a cover-up. I think Hydra murdered me.
Skye: Did you find the extraction beacon?
Simmons: Exactly where we programmed it.
Skye: Okay. We have to get out of here. Hydra is after you. We have to get somewhere safe.
Simmons: Coulson gave me up, didn’t he? He’s completely different, Daisy. You wouldn’t believe it. He let Hydra arrest a child.
Skye: May’s different, too. She’s like number three in Hydra and way more damaged than in the real world.
Simmons: Everything’s worse here. I woke up buried alive, was ditched on the side of the road, nearly arrested, and found Coulson brainwashing the young.
Skye: It sounds bad, but wait till you hear how I woke up.
Simmons: Why did Radcliffe build this place? He was never into Hydra.
Ward: Ladies.
Simmons: Ward.
Ward: We need to talk.
Ward: How did you know my name? Who are you? Skye, what have you told her?
Simmons: So it’s Skye again.
Ward: You have another name?
Skye: No. I’m Skye.
Ward: Why’s Hydra after her? Is she your source in the Resistance?
Skye: What source? No, she’s a friend.
Simmons: What is he doing here?
Man: All right, let’s go! Down this trail!
Simmons: Daisy, they’re coming. You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us!
Skye: Stop it! Stop it! Ward, look at me. I have never betrayed you, ever. We’re real.
Ward: Is she your source for the Resistance?
Skye: No!
Simmons: No!
Skye: Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!
Man: Over here! Unh!
Ward: But I do. Come on. We got to get out of here.
Man : Come on! Use lethal force if necessary!
Ward: We got move, now! Whose car is this?
Simmons: Mine.
Ward: Keys, now!
Simmons: What? No!
Ward: Keys, or we all die!
Simmons: What the hell is going on?!
Skye: I have no idea.
Ward: Skye, there’s no good way to tell you this, but I had the test results when you were screened. You’re an Inhuman.
Skye: I know.
Ward: You know?
Ward: Cover us!
Simmons: So, you’re Hydra, and you’ve been protecting Skye?
Ward: Yeah. That’s why I joined the Resistance.
Simmons: Oh, always the double agent. And this is who you woke up with? You two were together? Oh, this isn’t the Framework. This is Hell.
Skye: They’re gaining on us!
Ward: How did you know Vijay Nadeer’s real name?
Skye: Why do you care?
Ward: I was the one who got his ID cards!
Skye: You’re a mole?
Simmons: What a surprise.
Skye: You knocked him out to shut him up.
Ward: Yeah. He was helpful until you burned him. Hold on!
Skye: What are you doing? We’ll get stuck.
Ward: Drones will be here any second.
Simmons: Drones?
Ward: Dwarfs, whatever. The Doctor invented them. They’re everywhere. Metro’s just up those steps. Two stops to your apartment. You’ll be safe there. I’ll clear the car. Go, go, go.
Skye: Ward, I’m sorry about Vijay. I got caught up, and I… I had to give May something. I didn’t know it could be you.
Ward: What is your name?
Skye: Daisy.
Ward: We’ll talk. Get out of here. Go.
May: One agent was killed. The others lost the vehicle in Bethesda. We’re canvassing the area.
The Doctor: It was one girl.
May: One girl with help, who knew our tactics. Maybe whoever helped her also made this. It’s not a forgery.
The Doctor: A mole. Well, that’s a serious charge.
May: Someone is betraying us.
The Doctor: You know, my father always said you have to have trust to be betrayed. Treat this mole like a cancer.
May: I’ll cut it out myself.
The Doctor: Well, you failed before. Never forget how it felt at Cambridge. Did the Dwarfs record these people?
May: The footage was sent straight to the Director. By request.
Simmons: You saw Fitz, didn’t you? Is he like the others? Brainwashed?
Skye: Yeah, he was different. But, Simmons, they all are. It’s scary. Why change things like this? It makes no sense.
Simmons: Radcliffe tried to take away people’s pain in the Framework.
Skye: Wait. You’re right. May’s biggest pain was killing the girl in Bahrain. You take that away, and hundreds of kids are killed in Boston.
Simmons: And Coulson is leading a quiet life. I’m worried he’s not the same man.
Skye: He really let them take a kid?
Simmons: And what did they do to Fitz to make him such an ugly person here?
Skye: Well, that one’s easy. They stole you from his life.
Simmons: What if he never knew me? What if he can’t remember? This… This reality is flawless. It lures you in.
Skye: I know, I know. Can’t even believe what I found myself doing. I… I looked up Lincoln. I… I… I interrogated Vijay for being an Inhuman. And I have been here one day. May’s been here weeks. She thinks it’s her whole life.
Simmons: A few choices and a few lives. Radcliffe ran a simulation. Now it’s a brave new terrifying world.
Skye: Okay. Um… We need to get out.
Simmons: What? N… No, we can’t leave them.
Skye: We have to talk to Yo-Yo and come back with a game plan, with backup. I don’t have powers here.
Simmons: Okay.
Skye: Why are we still here?
Simmons: I’m not sure. This should disconnect us from the Framework, wake us up. They know we’re here.
Skye: You’re supposed to be dead. Someone re-coded our exit.
Simmons: We’re trapped.
The Doctor: Good evening, Madame.
Ophelia: Leopold. Come in.
The Doctor: These subversives need to be taken seriously. Apparently, they’ve got a mole inside Hydra. A traitor.
Ophelia: I know. I’ve tightened security. Eliminated a loophole for their escape. Next, we tighten the noose.
The Doctor: So, you have surveillance on…?
Ophelia: On one of them, yes.
The Doctor: I’d like to see it.
Ophelia: No. Your work is too important to be distracted by these criminals.
The Doctor: I won’t stand by as they try to destroy everything that we have built. I have to protect that. I have to protect you. I have…
Ophelia: Your anger won’t solve this. It’s your creativity that we need.
Skye: Hey.
Coulson: Who are you? Are you with the other person? This is not okay.
Skye: Coulson, I need you to remember me.
Coulson: I’m sorry. We haven’t met.
Skye: We have. Please, remember me.
Coulson: No. This isn’t real. You’re not here.
Skye: I am. I am. Please. Remember me.
Coulson: I’m sorry. I don’t.
Skye: It’s not your fault. It’s just, you’re the person that I go to when things get heavy. And this world is scary, and nothing makes sense, and you’re the closest thing I have to family. So I just hope that deep down, you feel it, too.
Coulson: Daisy?
