Coulson: So, we’re both from the “real world,” we’re S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, our bodies are being held captive, and this is all a virtual prison, built to keep us sedated. Am I missing anything?
Skye: No, that’s about the gist of it.
Coulson: I knew I wasn’t crazy. Hydra lies about everything. The news? It’s all fake. Take the Cambridge Incident. It was a setup. That girl shouldn’t have been at that school in the first place.
Skye: Where we’re from, she died. This never happened.
Amy: Hey, Mr. Coulson, my homework was done, I swear, but then my dad made me…
Coulson: Amy, we’ve been over this. Until first bell, this is my time.
Amy: Right. Okay. Geez. Sorry.
Coulson: It’s okay. Hydra used Cambridge to take control, in the name of law and order to justify everything. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
Skye: I knew if anyone would understand, it’d be you.
Coulson: I would’ve figured it out a long time ago if it wasn’t for the mind-control soap.
Skye: Yeah. Wait. What?
Coulson: That blue soap everyone uses? Hydra loads it up with chemicals. It seeps into our bloodstream. Implants false memories into our brains. They want us to believe this is a magical place. But don’t worry, I’m clear. I make my own soap now.
Skye: No, I think that you’re talking about Project TAHITI. They messed with your head a little bit, which is why you probably remember some things, uh, Why don’t we put the soap theories on hold just for one second, okay? Yeah?
Ward: We got a problem.
Skye: Oh, you have no idea.
Ward: Something big’s going down over here. They’re sending a unit to pick up your teacher friend.
Skye: You’re gonna need a substitute.
Mack: Come on. Don’t quit on me. Not now. Not now. How did you beat me?
Hope: The human brain peaks as early as age 24. Face it, you’re slowing down, Dad.
Mack: Oh, is that right? Well, tell me, show-off, what’d you use for an electronic speed control?
Hope: Well, I sort of found something by school, in the park.
Mack: A Hydra drone?
Hope: Maybe I borrowed a part or two.
Mack: Hope, you know better. We don’t mess around with those guys.
Hope: It was all crashed and messed up. I made sure no one was looking…
Mack: No, no, we stay off Hydra’s radar, we keep our heads down, and follow their rules, always. Always!
Hope: I know. I’m really, really sorry, Daddy.
Mack: It’s okay. It’s okay. Come here. Just want you to be more careful, all right? I tell you what. I’ll take the drone parts back later, and then you and I can try to get mine working together. But you got to promise to go easy on your old man.
Hope: No promises.
Mack: No promises? No? No? Get out of here. Go on. Go get your bag. We’ll be late for the bus.
Mack: All right, Sparkplug. 10 o'clock.
Hope: Easy. Harley-Davidson.
Mack: Engine?
Hope: Twin cam, 88.
Mack: Ooh! That’s my girl. Keep your head down. Do what they say. I’m right here with you.
Agent: Move it, move it! Line up! IDs out! You know the drill. Let’s get them out now!
Man: Got to be contraband. They busted my neighbor for a laptop last night.
Hope: The drone, it’s in my bag.
Mack: What?
Hope: I was gonna take it back myself so you wouldn’t get in trouble.
Mack: I’ll handle this.
Agent: We’ve got a runner. Freeze.
Agent: Get him! Hands behind your back!
Agent: He’s on the list, potential Inhuman. Take him away.
Mack: It’s okay. It’s okay.
Simmons: Hi.
Coulson: Oh, hi. It’s me again, Phil Coulson. I called Hydra on you. My bad.
Simmons: Water under the proverbial bridge. I’m so glad to see you, sir.
Coulson: Apparently, in the real world, I have a robot hand. Pretty cool, right?
Skye: And here, he makes his own soap.
Simmons: How about that.
Coulson: I do. You should, too.
Skye: Okay. We need to move. Hydra came back for Coulson. Ward warned us away, but we barely made it out.
Simmons: Oh, thank goodness for Grant Ward.
Skye: I don’t love it, either, but this is the second time he’s helped us. And so I hate to say this, but I think we can trust him.
Simmons: Until we can’t. Betraying those closest to him is his signature move.
Skye: For now, we just need to get somewhere safe. Ward set up a time and place for us to meet the Resistance. It’s a whole password-exchange thing.
Coulson: Bona fides? I always wanted to do that.
Simmons: Or, I’ve been thinking. What if I reached out to Fitz?
Skye: Simmons, we’ve b… we’ve been over this.
Simmons: If you were able to get through to Coulson, then surely I could get Fitz to remember me.
Skye: Fitz is not the same. He’s different here.
Simmons: This reality may be upside down, but Fitz is still Fitz. He’s still a good person.
Skye: Who happens to be second in command at Hydra.
Simmons: Yeah, which means he has resources, not to mention Framework expertise, which we’ll need to get out of Radcliffe’s Hydra snow globe.
Coulson: Holden Radcliffe, the scientist? I… I-I saw something a while back, and I cut it out. I… Here it is. “Famed Hydra scientist working on Inhuman cure.” Something felt off about him. Do you know him? Do we know him?
Skye: Why would Radcliffe be in here?
Simmons: I don’t know. But think about it. - He built the Framework, which means…
Skye: He can help us get out.
Coulson: Yeah, one catch. Nobody’s seen him since this photo was taken.
Skye: You guys meet up with Ward’s contact. I’ll go back to the Triskelion and get a location on Radcliffe.
Simmons: Daisy, it’s too dangerous.
Skye: I’ll be fine. I’ll be in and out. No one will even know I’m there.
Agent: It’s only a matter of time before we find her. We’ve detained several Inhuman sympath…
Ophelia: Dismissed, Agent.
The Doctor: All this for one subversive? Why won’t you let me help you?
Ophelia: I need you focused on your work right now.
The Doctor: Project Looking Glass is ahead of schedule. Tell me what’s really going on.
Ophelia: It’s fine. I’m handling it.
The Doctor: Ophelia, I know that look. You’re worried. Who is she?
Ophelia: No one. She doesn’t matter. She’s plotting against me. I need to find her and expose anyone who’s helping her.
The Doctor: I’ll send my team. Consider the threat eliminated.
Ophelia: You’d really do anything for me, wouldn’t you?
The Doctor: I’d cross the universe for you.
Ward: What the hell are you doing?
Skye: I got a lead on someone who could take down this whole place.
Ward: It’s not safe here. I think they’re on to me.
Skye: This will go a lot faster if you would quit mouth-breathing on me.
Ward: Madame Hydra’s restricted files? You have lost your mind.
Skye: The soap made me do it. Let’s go.
May: Hold it! Skye, you need to come with us.
Ward: I’ll take May, you take the others. When we get to the door…
Skye: Get this to Simmons. She’ll know what to do.
Ward: Skye…
Skye: I’ll be fine. Go.
Simmons: According to Ward’s intel, the drone should leave in five seconds.
Coulson: This Ward guy, where we’re from, he’s a friend of ours?
Simmons: Uh, he was. Didn’t end well.
Simmons: I take it you’re our contact?
Man: For the season, it’s been unusually rainy.
Coulson: Rain or shine, the man with the umbrella is always ready. What? Did I say it wrong?
Man: Hands out front. Wrists together.
Simmons: Honestly, is this really necessary?
Coulson: Oh, cool!
Mace: I’m Jeffrey Mace. Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Mace: Sorry about the hoods, but trust is a luxury these days. That being said, Ward vouched for you, so I’m happy to provide you sanctuary.
Simmons: Thank you, sir. My name is Jemma Simmons, and this is…
Coulson: Phil Coulson. Wow. I can’t believe it’s really you. The Patriot! The Inhuman leader of the Resistance. He’s kind of a big deal!
Mace: Uh, Jeffrey’s fine. The Patriot’s a little much for my taste.
Coulson: Man, I dreamed about what your suit would look like. I made a few sketches, but this is actually way cooler.
Simmons: This place… what happened here?
Mace: For about years after World War II, nothing. No one even knew it was here. But then, a couple years back, a brave agent named Billy Koenig gave his life getting me the location. It’s taken all that time just to get it operational again.
Coulson: Got to say, the whole Rebel Alliance aesthetic’s really working for me.
Mace: I’ll take that as a compliment. I think? This way, please. The early days were tough. A lot of good agents died for this. Agent Burrows.
Burrows: Sir, it’s bad out there. And, uh… we lost Agent Cook. I’m sorry.
Mace: We honor him by continuing the fight.
Coulson: Who are these people?
Mace: Potentials. Some of them have the Inhuman gene or they had a relative who did.
Simmons: Hydra’s hunting them.
Mace: It’s all we can do to find them first, give them shelter, and relocate them somewhere safe. Well, look what the cat dragged in.
Ward: It’s been too long, sir.
Mace: What’s happened?
Ward: They got Skye.
Skye: Is this gonna take long?
May: We have a mission. Madame Hydra’s office requested you specifically.
Skye: Why me?
The Doctor: The target was spotted via drone yesterday. She’s been reaching out to leaders of the Resistance and is planning a major attack. Capture any subversives found on site, but do not underestimate this woman. Lethal force is authorized, if necessary.
Skye: Did you know about this?
The Doctor: And believe me, we will defeat these terrorists, and we will make our society great again.
May: Hail Hydra.
Hope: He was Inhuman, that man they took? Does that mean he’s bad?
Mack: I don’t know, Sparkplug.
Hope: Do we hate Inhumans?
Mack: No. They’re people, just like you and me.
Hope: But if they didn’t do anything wrong, why are they all being arrested?
Mack: Look, you’re smarter than most kids your age, and you pick up on things pretty quickly. But I don’t want you worrying about this stuff, okay?
Hope: What would’ve happened if they’d looked in my bag?
Mack: Then I would’ve taken care of it, ‘cause that’s my job. Tell you what, how about if we make some popcorn and watch a video?
Hope: “Chopping Mall?”
Mack: Again with that silly robot movie?
Hope: Don’t pretend you don’t love it.
Mack: Okay, okay. But I’m still fast-forwarding through the bad parts.
Ward: I don’t know. It all happened so fast.
Mace: From everything you’ve told me, Skye’s tough as hell. She can handle herself in there.
Simmons: Before they took her, did she get a location on Radcliffe?
Ward: You know, Skye hasn’t been herself ever since you showed up. What is it that you’re really after?
Simmons: You, of all people, the Hydra double agent, are doubting my loyalty. That is rich.
Mace: But don’t forget, you’re only here because I trust him, not you.
Simmons: Fine. You want to question me? When Hydra wiped out the Academy and people were dying, I was there. I fought and took a bullet. I had to claw my way out of a mass grave. How’s that for loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Mace: I apologize.
Simmons: Ogygia? These coordinates, they’re east of Bermuda. There shouldn’t be anything out there.
Mace: Who is this Radcliffe?
Simmons: He’s a scientist.
Ward: Skye said he could take down Hydra. What does that mean?
Simmons: I can’t be sure, but we need to find him as quickly as possible.
Mace: I’m sorry. With all that’s going on, I can’t send a team today.
Coulson: Then send us.
Mace: With all due respect, this is a spy organization and you’re a teacher.
Coulson: Seems you need all the help you can get.
Simmons: Skye did risk everything for this.
Ward: They may have a point, sir. I can pilot and supervise.
Skye: All this because of one subversive? Seems a little extreme.
May: Be quiet. Do your job.
Mack: No! No! No!
Hope: Daddy! Leave him alone! Daddy!
Mack: Let her go!
Hope: Daddy, help me! Daddy, help me! Daddy! Daddy!
Mack: She’s just a kid! She’s just a kid! Let her go!
Mace: The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it.
Ward: We’ve had to steal what vehicles we could.
Mace: Someday, this could really be special. Imagine a fleet of Quinjets launching from here.
Simmons: Imagine that.
Ward: Sir.
Mace: Good luck out there.
Simmons: Thank you.
Coulson: Why didn’t you tell them this reality’s fake?
Simmons: Keep your voice down.
Coulson: You lied to them.
Simmons: It wasn’t a lie. It was an omission. Not everyone is ready for that truth.
Coulson: Oh, but I am?
Simmons: Yes. So far, you’re the only one who remembers the way things should be.
Coulson: It’s only fragments.
Simmons: Fragments have got you this far.
Ward: We liberated this guy last year.
Coulson: This is a Quinjet?
Simmons: Yeah. And that fleet Mace described? You commanded it. Except yours were loads nicer, and you wouldn’t believe Zephyr One.
Mack: This has to be a mistake. We didn’t do anything. We… We shouldn’t be here.
May: You’re in a lot of trouble.
Mack: But we’re innocent. We keep our heads down, we obey the rules…
May: People who haven’t done anything don’t end up here.
Mack: We don’t want to cause any trouble. And Hope, she’s just a kid.
May: That doesn’t mean she’s innocent.
Mack: Please, I’ll do anything.
Ward: So, this Radcliffe, is he dangerous?
Simmons: Maybe not physically. But sometimes the greatest threats are the ones right in front of you.
Ward: I’m sorry.
Simmons: Excuse me?
Ward: I should’ve never left Skye.
Simmons: Oh. I’m sure she’ll be okay.
Ward: Which I keep telling myself, but if anything happens, I’d never forgive myself. I’d die for her.
Simmons: Why don’t I give you a minute?
Simmons: Everything all right?
Coulson: It’s been years since I’ve even been on a plane.
Simmons: It’s perfectly normal to be nervous.
Coulson: For the longest time, I just wanted someone to believe me and tell me I wasn’t crazy.
Simmons: You are not crazy.
Coulson: I live alone and make my own soap.
Simmons: I… Uh… It’s quaint. Hipster, even.
Coulson: That’s not how my ex-wife saw it. Who am I kidding? I’m not remotely qualified to be here.
Simmons: I know the real Coulson, and I believe in you, even if you don’t just now. You’re exactly where you’re meant to be.
Ward: 30 minutes out.
Ophelia: Leopold? What’s wrong?
The Doctor: Turns out your new subversive was executed at the Academy. But I suppose you knew that already, didn’t you?
Ophelia: I can explain.
The Doctor: So, she’s an Inhuman, then? What else have you been keeping from me?
Ophelia: This woman is not from here. She crossed over from the other side.
The Doctor: I thought that was impossible.
Ophelia: As did I.
The Doctor: So this is why you’ve been so keen on finishing Project Looking Glass.
Ophelia: The people from that world want to destroy what we’ve built. I was only trying to protect you.
The Doctor: You never talk about your time there. Why? Tell me the truth. You owe me that much.
Ophelia: Over there, the worst thing happened. S.H.I.E.L.D. won the war. Hydra lost. I was their slave. Treated as less than human. When I escaped, I hoped they couldn’t follow me, but…
The Doctor: Here they are.
Ophelia: If I can’t return there and defeat my enemies, we’ll never be safe. Everything I do is so that you and I can be together.
Ophelia: We’ll finish this later. Come.
Skye: I’m Skye. What’s your name?
Hope: Hope Mackenzie.
Skye: Hope. You’re the Hope that he lost.
Hope: He didn’t lose me. I was taken by you people. My Dad follows the rules. He’s a good person.
Skye: I’m sure he is.
Hope: Then let us go home.
Skye: I wish it was that simple. It’s not my call.
Hope: Dad warned me not to mess around with that drone, but I didn’t listen. This is all my fault. I…
Skye: Hey, hey, it’s okay. Your dad’s gonna be all right. I promise.
Hope: Please help my dad. Don’t let anything happen to him, please.
May: Get anything from the girl?
Skye: She’s scared. What about her dad?
May: I haven’t broken him, yet.
Skye: I was just with Hope. She’s safe. That’s one special girl.
Mack: Thank you. Listen, we need to talk.
Skye: Do you know who I am?
Mack: You’re Daisy Johnson. We’re both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Skye: Yes. Yes. Oh, thank God. Okay. We need to get you out of here, reconnect with Coulson and Simmons.
Mack: Definitely.
Skye: Yo-Yo is with us on the outside. She’s safe. You have no idea how worried she is about you. You don’t know who she is.
Mack: Uh…
Skye: And me? Do you know me?
Mack: I’m sorry. That’s what the other agent told me to say.
May: Lock down the elevators. Find her!
Ward: Simple extraction. We grab him and go. Keep your eyes open.
Simmons: I’ll do the talking.
Coulson: What about me? What should I do?
Ward: Just try to not to get yourself killed.
Simmons: Consider it a precaution. A “break glass in case of emergency.”
Ward: Drop it.
Radcliffe: Hive? No. It can’t be.
Simmons: Hello, again, traitor.
Coulson: Surprise.
Radcliffe: You shouldn’t be here. None of you.
Ward: Unh-unh. That’s close enough, pal.
Radcliffe: Oh, but… No, you’re not Hive at all. You’re the one who came before. I never did meet him.
Simmons: This is not a social visit.
Radcliffe: Oh, Jemma, if only you knew the trials and tribulations I’ve endured.
Simmons: I am fresh out of sympathy for liars who kidnap my friends and replace them with killer androids.
Coulson: Don’t forget about implanting bogus memories and letting me think I’m off my gourd. Not cool, bro.
Ward: Catch up later. We need to move.
Radcliffe: It’s all become so very complicated. I never meant to hurt anyone.
Simmons: Right now, I don’t give a damn about what you meant. You’re going to help us find our friends and escape.
Radcliffe: My dear, I’m afraid there is no escape from this place.
Man: Sector 7 clear. We’ll be going on to the next floor.
Skye: Going down?
May: There’s no way out. It’s over.
Man: Don’t move. Give me your hands. Get down.
Radcliffe: This isn’t the world I’d intended. Things have gone dreadfully wrong.
Coulson: Maybe not so much for you.
Radcliffe: I promise you, this is a gilded cage. One can only drink so many mai tais, watch so many sunsets…
Simmons: Oh, stuff it. You’re in early retirement while the rest of your world tears itself apart.
Radcliffe: I assure you, my intentions were pure. The Framework was to be a paradise, a-a pleasant forever-after.
Ward: All right, story time is over. You’re coming with us.
Radcliffe: I’m afraid that’s not possible.
Ward: That wasn’t a request. Who is that?
Radcliffe: No one. It’s unimportant.
Ward: You guys watch him. I’ll go and get her.
Radcliffe: No, you can’t drag her into this! It’ll only confuse her. She doesn’t remember the other world.
Simmons: It’s Agnes.
Radcliffe: Agnes was dying. In order to save her, I had to bring her consciousness into the Framework.
Simmons: And her body?
Radcliffe: Deceased, I’m afraid. We gave her a burial at sea. It was very emotional. The Framework is all Agnes has left.
Ward: Okay, what the hell is he talking about?
Coulson: To be honest, he lost me there, too.
Radcliffe: As a matter of fact, she’s not the only one in that particular boat. AIDA sort of killed me, as well.
Simmons: What?! How did she go against her programming?
Radcliffe: She found a loophole. I mean, it was really rather clever. If I weren’t dead already, I’d be impressed.
Ward: We’re getting that woman, and we’re going. We can sort this out at H.Q.
Radcliffe: I never wanted any of this to happen. I only wanted to do good.
Simmons: Then actually do good. Tell me where AIDA is keeping our friends.
Radcliffe: The Russian has a base under a drilling platform in the Baltic. Go and save them, and leave us in peace.
Coulson: How do we get out? Did you build an exit back to the real world?
Radcliffe: Of course I did, but I suspect AIDA’s discovered it by now. You’ll just have to go however you came in.
Simmons: That’s the problem. Ours isn’t working.
Radcliffe: Yeah, but that means… Oh, dear God. Then she knows you’re here.
Ward: Who?! Who?! Who is “she?”
Radcliffe: Oh, my… Go! Hide! Hide! All of you!
Ophelia: Search the island. Find them.
The Doctor: You two, with me.
Coulson: Look at that plane. What kind of monster flies around in something that size?
Radcliffe: We had a deal. You promised me if I stayed on the island, out of your way, you’d leave us alone.
Ophelia: Drop the indignation, doctor. This island’s no-fly zone was breached an hour ago. We both know you’re harboring subversives. And I’ll find them soon enough.
Simmons: What is Fitz doing with AIDA?
Ward: I don’t know who AIDA is, but that’s Madame Hydra.
Radcliffe: Subversives? They are people who happen to be our friends. I wanted to help them. You’ve turned them into prisoners!
Ophelia: I did exactly as you asked.
Radcliffe: Don’t play innocent with me. We both know it’s gone much further than that.
Ophelia: I took away their one greatest regret. How things played out from there wasn’t up to me.
Radcliffe: You put yourself into the framework. You’ve been manipulating it ever since. The whole thing is an unmitigated disaster, and all you do is lie!
Ophelia: Sometimes it’s okay to lie to save a life. You taught me that.
Radcliffe: Don’t use my words or my bloody programming against me, AIDA!
Ophelia: Do not call me that here. “AIDA” is an acronym. The “A” stands for “artificial.” Do you know how degrading it is? To be kept in a closet, to be used, to be treated as a thing? Well, I am not your tool. Not anymore.
The Doctor: Found one in the back.
Agnes: Holden, what’s happening? Who are these people?
Mack: Sparkplug. You okay? I’m so sorry.
Hope: I’m all right. Really. Skye! What happened? She was nice to me.
May: Hydra thanks you for your service.
Hope: Daddy?
Mack: Hail Hydra.
The Doctor: Well, it’s exactly as you said. The other side’s coming for us. She even has your face.
Agnes: Wh… why does she look like me, Holden?
Radcliffe: Don’t panic, love. I can explain all of this. I-I-I-I’ve meaning to, really, but the timing just…
Ophelia: This man is from the other side. He’s the one who enslaved me.
Radcliffe: What?! Now, hold on. That’s a pretty extreme bit of paraphrasing, - don’t you think…
Ophelia: He used me. Kept me as his property.
Radcliffe: Leopold, my dear boy, I don’t know what lies she’s been feeding you, but…
Ophelia: He wants what we have for himself. He means to replace me with her.
Radcliffe: No. That couldn’t be further from the truth. This is Agnes. She’s harmless. There’s no threat. You have to believe me.
Agnes: Aah!
The Doctor: Then convince me.
Simmons: This isn’t real, Jemma. This world isn’t real.
Coulson: He’s gonna kill her.
Simmons: Fitz would never do that.
Coulson: Are you sure?
Ward: Get back to the Quintjet. I’ll deal with this and meet you there.
Simmons: Stop. We’re going to need him.
Ward: Need the doctor? Are you nuts?
Simmons: There’s more you don’t understand.
Ward: I know everything I need to know. The man is a sadist, and I have a shot. That’s the mission now.
Coulson: Listen to her.
Simmons: Please.
Ward: You know, you’ve been lying to me since the moment we met. A woman’s life is in danger. I’m done listening.
Simmons: You’re right. I haven’t told you the whole story. It’s complicated, but I know him, not as the doctor, but as a… a brilliant, awkward, heroic scientist named Leopold James Fitz. He is a good man, and I love him. That woman, Madame Hydra? She’s… she’s messed with his mind. If you do this, I lose him forever. I will tell you everything, everything, I just… I need you to trust me. Fitz would never hurt an innocent woman.
Radcliffe: Y-you’re right. The subversives are here. I-I-I-I see now, I should’ve been more forthcoming. Please, put the gun down. I’ll… I’ll take you to them.
The Doctor: Tell me the truth. You act like you know me. Why?
Ophelia: The soldiers can find the subversives. We should be going.
Radcliffe: You were like a son to me. We worked side by side in the lab, on occasion, we’d raise a pint… or six. Watching football. Real football.
The Doctor: That’s absurd.
Radcliffe: It’s the truth, my boy. You even helped me build AIDA.
Ophelia: Enough! We’re done here.
The Doctor: Then why don’t I remember you?
Radcliffe: Because it all happened in the other world.
Ophelia: It wasn’t you, Fitz. It was their world’s version of you.
The Doctor: And the woman? Jemma Simmons?
Radcliffe: Simmons? You two were in love. Unbreakable. A force to be reckoned with. The Fitz I knew nearly drowned for Jemma. He crossed the bloody universe to rescue her!
Ophelia: You see what we’re up against? They mean to destroy us.
Radcliffe: She lies because I’m right. She’s trying to deceive you.
Ophelia: I love you. They’re trying to take you away from me.
Radcliffe: The world has changed, but you’re not this man. You’re one of the good guys. You help people. Look inside. This isn’t you.
The Doctor: You say that I’m not myself. I don’t know who I am.
Radcliffe: It isn’t your fault, any of it.
The Doctor: But you’re wrong. I know exactly who I am.
Simmons: Fitz! No!
Coulson: Get back!
Ward: Go! Now!
Ward: Hang on to something!
Coulson: How about that? There was nothing else you could’ve done.
Simmons: He killed Agnes. Fitz killed her.
Coulson: I’m sorry.
Mace: Someone had better explain what the hell happened out there, pronto! Ward tells me he had a shot on the doctor, but you stopped him. And that you’re in love with that psychopath!
Coulson: We can explain everything.
Ward: She says Madame Hydra brainwashed him.
Mace: That’s a bold claim. You have evidence, or do we have to take this at face value, too?
Coulson: She’s been through a lot.
Mace: We all have. Step aside.
Coulson: This can wait.
Ward: No, she owes us answers.
Simmons: This is wrong. We don’t even belong here! None of this is real!
Coulson: Please! She just needs some time.
Burrows: Sir. A recon team found a civilian sniffing around one of our dead drops. He’s got quite the story.
Mace: Well, glad somebody wants to talk. Let’s hear it.
Mack: I met a woman today who was with S.H.I.E.L.D. Her name is Daisy Johnson. You might know her as Skye? Hydra used me to trick her and take her captive.
Ward: No. Please tell me she’s okay.
Mace: Why are you here?
Mack: Today, for the first time, I couldn’t look my little girl in the eye. I need to make that right. I’m here to help.
Radcliffe: I take it all back! I’m sorry! I can beg! I’m good at begging! Just tell me what to say! Please!
Skye: Fitz. Hear me out. You and me. We know each other. We’re friends. I can explain all of this.
The Doctor: How curious. Someone else tried that today. Maybe you heard him just now, learning his lesson. Hoo. So, I re-ran your test results. Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman. Go on. Guess. Ah, well. No matter. We’ve got plenty of ways of making you talk.
Skye: No, Fitz. You don’t want to do this.
The Doctor: Yeah, I do.
Skye: No.
The Doctor: I guess you don’t know me at all.
