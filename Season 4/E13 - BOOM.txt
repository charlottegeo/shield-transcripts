Coulson: I’d be the first to admit that I’ve followed my worst instincts at times. Last year. Loss will make you do that. It feels good in the moment. Gracias. But it never ends well. I’ve lost my temper.I ’ve killed. But lately, I have this voice in my head telling me not to go down that path again. It’s telling me to be patient, to stay steady.
Mack: I take it you don’t mean me, sir.
Coulson: It’s Agent May. She’d tell me to stay on mission.
Mack: Listen to the woman. She knows what she’s talking about. Hold on. This could be her.
Coulson: Careful. This woman disappeared from her old life. We don’t know if we can trust her, but she could be…
Mack: I know. She could lead us to May. Damn it.I don’t have confirmation.
Coulson: Her face will be all the confirmation we need.
Agnes: Buenos dias, Roberto. I ’ll have the usual, please.
Roberto: Ready to go, Agnes. How is your day?
Agnes: Good day so far, thanks.
Mack: I’d say that’s confirmation.
Radcliffe: My God. AIDA, it’s astonishing.
AIDA: Agent May kept finding the edges of our simulations. That’s no longer a concern, given the Earth has no edges. It’s round.
Radcliffe: I understood that conceptually, we were building a world, but I-I didn’t expect you would build our entire world.
AIDA: With slight improvements.
Radcliffe: And Agent May, she’s happy?
AIDA: The clinical definition of happy is difficult to quantify. But she meets much of the criteria.
Radcliffe: Well, then, that’s a yes. Whatever price we needed to pay for the Darkhold, it was worth it. Welcome, welcome. Morning checkup?
Ivanov: It’s midnight. Does that thing have to be in here?
Radcliffe: Of course not. Well, this place is perfect. All the power we need. And undetectable?
Ivanov: I believe so.I ’ve lived here for many years.
Radcliffe: Great! But that… that book… you really shouldn’t touch that. It’s… It’s dangerous, powerful.
Ivanov: I’m aware. I read it while you were sleeping.
Radcliffe: You did what?! I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher…
Ivanov: You said it would help me find a solution to eliminate the Inhuman problem.
Radcliffe: I said don’t touch it! Could warp the senses, corrupt the mind.
Ivanov: Relax.I glanced at it, and it gave me a simple answer. You.
Shockley: Why do you think you’re still alive?
Ivanov: As we discussed when you first arrived, we have plans for a future together.
Radcliffe: Yes. I’ve already worked out the first step.
Shockley: You found an Inhuman to dangle in front of S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Radcliffe: Well, no. Because as you’re aware, they are not easy to come by. Until now. Pure Terrigen crystals. I picked up some samples last year when I was working for a previous benefactor. His goals were… well, the complete opposite of yours, so I’ve been working to refine the compound, grow it…
Shockley: Superior…
Radcliffe: The… The chemical in this pure form is harmless to humans. If you’re a potential Inhuman, however it will turn you.
Ivanov: We’re counting on it.
Fitz: Oh, for the love of… What now? Oh, that’s for me. Dial in that scanner. I can’t have it detecting every metal clothes hanger as an LMD. Coulson’s a prosthetic hand, for God sakes.
Agent: Yes, sir.
Simmons: That’s enough for now.
Mace: Agent Simmons?
Simmons: It’s not good news, I’m afraid. The serum that’s been giving you your strength. It is potentially lethal.
Mace: So you’re saying it’s a little risky.
Simmons: I’m saying it’s Russian roulette. You’ve been fortunate so far, but the next injection might cause cardiac arrest. And if it doesn’t, the one after is even more likely to kill you, and so on and so on until…
Mace: Geez. Don’t sugarcoat it, Doc. And by that, I mean, please, go ahead and sugarcoat it.
Simmons: I’m sorry. I know General Talbot was hoping to replicate what was done to Steve Rogers, but… but you’ll never be Captain America.
Mace: But, you know, I agreed not to take the serum until you completed the medical tests. I’m even in daily physical conditioning, learning to fight.
Simmons: Yeah, and I hear you’re doing well.
Mace: Agent Piper had me pinned in 10 seconds this morning.
Simmons: Tomorrow, it will be 12.
Mace: No, you don’t understand. I need my strength. We’re already a man down.
Simmons: We are all doing everything to find Agent May.
Mace: I know. And I’m a team player. I’m willing to play any position that gets us the win. But I already went from head coach to quarterback, and now you’re telling me I’m gonna be on the bench for the season?
Simmons: Sir, I have no doubt you will find your place on the footie squad.
Fitz: Ladies and gentlemen, straight from engineering and complete with all the modifications that you requested. Director Mace, say goodbye to your briefcase, because you now have a serum-delivery device on the belt of your suit. Just one turn, and the injection is delivered directly into the… The tests… The tests didn’t go that well, did they? Okay. Well, in that case, it’s also good that we added a heart monitor and a GPS, so when you do use the injection…
Simmons: Fitz. He can’t. It’s too dangerous.
Fitz: Oh. You could… could’ve told me that before I did my whole big presentation.
Cecilio: Director, we got to keep you on schedule.
Mace: Oh, thank God.
Daisy: If our friends in Calgary could take asset 63-D94A, that would be better. She’s gonna need a cold climate. And remember, the relocation data is for S.H.I.E.L.D.’s eyes only, so if you get any pushback, you know how to find me.
Agent: Copy that, Agent Johnson.
Mace: Inhuman relocation?
Daisy: The people who want to kill them have the Darkhold. We have to assume that every Inhuman is a potential target.
Mace: Senator Nadeer is gonna fight us on this. The Sokovia Accords give her a right to their locations.
Daisy: That’s why you’ll make sure the U.N. backs our play, no matter how many grueling bureaucratic conference calls you have to make.
Mace: Phil, how’s the fishing expedition?
Coulson: Turns out Fitz was right. Radcliffe didn’t create AIDA out of thin air. He modeled her after someone, a woman named Agnes Kitsworth. Australian expat living in Spain. We’ve been surveilling her, but she seems uncompromised.
Mace: Well, let’s hope she can lead us to Agent May. So how can I help?
Coulson: You’re doing it.
Mace: Mm, I want to be here for you, Phil. Radcliffe has the Darkhold, May is missing, Nadeer and her Russians are gunning for the Inhumans. I need to do something more.
Coulson: I know. I felt the same way when I started working with the Avengers. It’s not easy to find your place when you’re working with heroes and gods.
Mace: So what did you do?
Coulson: I did my best to protect the team. Turns out I had a role to play. You’ll make the right decision at the right time. Or you’ll get an Asgardian staff through the chest. I’d try to avoid that part.
Mace: Goes without saying. Thanks, Phil.
Coulson: It’s a replica, you know. The original’s in Majorca.
Agnes: Yeah, I know.
Coulson: You know because you’ve spent time in Majorca or because you know a thing or two about replicas?
Agnes: I’m sorry. Have we met?
Coulson: Not yet. But I know about the work you did with Holden Radcliffe.
Agnes: Our work? You don’t know anything.
Coulson: Then help me to understand.
Agnes: Okay. I don’t want anything to do with that man ever again. Understand? Now leave me alone.
Mack: We’re with S.H.I.E.L.D. We need to talk.
Coulson: Show her.
Agnes: Oh, my God. He actually did it.
Nadeer: If the U.N. want to play hardball, then we’ll throw harder. I want the public up in arms about S.H.I.E.L.D. hiding Inhumans in their backyards, and I want it by the evening news.
Man: I’ll call a press conference.
Nadeer: And book me some follow-up appearances on talk radio, you know which networks and… What are you doing here?
Shockley: I need a word. You’re comfortable with them hearing this?
Nadeer: I have no secrets from my staff.
Shockley: Mm. We’ve been discussing your role in this. You’ve been very impressive on the front lines, proven over and over again your commitment to this cause.
Nadeer: Thank you. I ’ve made some sacrifices, yes.
Shockley: I saw it myself. And I’ve wondered which was worse. Realizing your brother was infected and had to die because of it or realizing you have the same blood coursing through your veins?
Nadeer: I don’t appreciate your implication. I’m not that alien filth. Not now. Maybe not ever. But that gene passes on and on. And on. Maybe even skips a generation, maybe not. But everyone that carries it is part of the plague.
Nadeer: How dare you. I want you out of my office.
Shockley: Superior knows it’s not your fault. And you’ll play a role in this.
Nadeer: No, wait!
Shockley: No matter what happens.
Nadeer: Stop. Wait. I’m okay. I’m…
Shockley: No. No! Nooo!!
Nadeer: You thought it was me? Look at you. You’re disgusting, you son of a…
Reporter: Details are scarce, but it appears that Senator Ellen Nadeer’s office was ground zero in an explosion that looks deliberately set. Many are asking if Nadeer’s outspoken anti-Inhuman stance made her a target. Currently, there are no suspects, but the FBI is…
Mace: Is it possible? Could an Inhuman have done this?
Daisy: No way. They’ve all been accounted for by me.
Fitz: We can’t account for the Inhumans that we don’t know about or the sympathizers.
Daisy: Come on, you guys. This is just another setup. Nadeer’s furious about the relocations, and she wants people riled up against Inhumans.
Simmons: Would Nadeer go so far as to bomb her own office?
Daisy: Trust me, she’s gonna show up on the news having just missed the blast, and she’s gonna pin it all on S.H.I.E.L.D. That’s what she does.
Mace: Daisy.
Reporter: We’re just getting confirmation from the FBI. We have four confirmed casualties and one positive identification. We are sad to confirm that Senator Ellen Nadeer, leader in the Humans First movement, is among the dead. Reporting live for CNB, we’ll send it back…
Daisy: Okay. Well, we can’t be too sad. She did try to have you killed.
Mace: She could’ve been brought to justice. Now we won’t get that chance. But it’s not too late to do the right thing. Grab what you need. It’s time to show the world what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for.
Coulson: So I’ll mark you down as shocked but not surprised, which is surprising.
Agnes: Well, Holden’s whole post-human work started with replacing body parts, why not go for the whole shebang?
Coulson: I can think of about a million reasons why not, but Radcliffe did it anyway. He called her AIDA. And he could have made her look like anyone, but he chose you.
Agnes: Yeah, I got that part. Thanks.
Coulson: You said you didn’t work together. Were you special to him?
Agnes: I thought so. But what I really was to him was the one thing he couldn’t quite fix. No matter what he tried, he always hit a brick wall. How we felt about each other didn’t matter. What mattered was that he couldn’t deal with failure. So he left me. Ran, really.
Coulson: What is it?
Agnes: Glioblastoma multiforme. I know, it’s boring. Just your garden variety brain tumor. But at least it’s in a really interesting place, which makes it totally inoperable.
Mack: I’m sorry.
Agnes: See, that’s why I’m here. So I don’t have to hear that every day. Anyway, thanks for ruining one of the few good days I have left. Finding out your nightmare ex has built a robot replacement of you is a lot to process, so I’d appreciate it if you let me go.
Coulson: I can’t let you do that.
Mack: Coulson.
Coulson: We need to find Radcliffe, and you’re gonna help us.
Agnes: No, I’m not. I’m living out the rest of my life on my terms, and that means having nothing to do with Holden Radcliffe.
Coulson: I understand your situation, and I don’t want to make you cooperate, but if I have to…
Agnes: I wake up and face death every day. You think I’m scared of you?
FBI agent: I don’t know what you hope to accomplish by waltzing in here with that logo on your jackets, but it’s bad for all of us.
Reporter: Director Mace, are Inhumans behind this?
Daisy: You said you wanted to show the world what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for.
Mace: Well, I was hoping to do that by solving this thing.
Daisy: We got this.
Mace: So I guess now I’m the team mascot.
Coulson: We’ve got an address. I’m bringing her into custody.
Mack: Then you’ll be doing it alone.
Coulson: Agnes gets us to Radcliffe. Radcliffe gets us to May…
Mack: She said she couldn’t help us.
Coulson: She said she wouldn’t. There’s a difference.
Mack: This is a woman’s life. The end of her life. Just give her some peace.
Coulson: This is May we’re talking about.
Mack: Yes. May. The voice in your head telling you not to be reckless this time.
Coulson: I’m not planning on punching a hole in the universe and releasing a demon into the world.
Mack: Well, for Agnes, Radcliffe is the demon. Even if she agrees to reach out to him, we don’t know if Radcliffe has May. We don’t even know if May is still…
Coulson: Go ahead. Finish that thought.
Mack: Look, I know how hard it is to let go of someone you love. But there’s gonna come a time when you have to realize…
Coulson: I’m not giving up on May. When I was gone, she never gave up on me. So I’m gonna make Agnes cooperate. You don’t need to be part of it.
Fitz: How am I not finding any trace of bomb-making material?
Simmons: Probably the same way I’m not finding any trace of accelerant.
Fitz: Has to be something.
Simmons: Clearly.
Fitz: And yet, there is nothing.
Simmons: So, we take a bit of everything and test a bit of everything, old-school. Like in the chem lab, at our old school.
Daisy: Guess who was seen entering Nadeer’s office right before the blast? Cattle-prod enthusiast Tucker Shockley. He was with the Russians who took the Darkhold. And if memory serves, I quaked his ass.
Fitz: Senator Nadeer was also aligned with the Russians. Why would they want her dead?
Daisy: Villain-on-villain violence?
Simmons: If the Russians and Radcliffe have the Darkhold, they could have created a new, untraceable explosive.
Fitz: I really hate that book.
Daisy: However they did this, if Shockley’s not one of the three bodies in the morgue right now, he’s our bomber. We need to find him.
Simmons: How does a facial-recognition search in the city with the most surveillance cameras on the planet sound?
Daisy: Like a good start.
Man: Thought you didn’t make it.
Shockley: No. Almost didn’t. I-I… Unh!
Ivanov: I told you to bring her to me if she didn’t turn, not to set off a bomb and blow her to pieces.
Shockley: I released the Terrigen, like we planned. She turned. She became a husk, a thing. Then it exploded. Maybe the doc’s Terrigen was bad! I don’t know.
Ivanov: How did you get out?
Shockley: I don’t remember. Give me a chance to prove myself. I know that I can…
Ivanov: How am I supposed to trust you?
Shockley: You… are my… Superior.
Ivanov: That’s all I wanted to hear. I leave the city now. You’ve made it far too great a risk to even be in this country. We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. will come for you and try to take you down.
Shockley: And I will take them down with me.
Daisy: If you have to shoot, be precise. We don’t even know what these explosives look like.
Agent: Got it.
Agent: Go! Go, move! Stay down!
Coulson: Hi. I was planning on coming down here, try to throw my weight around, force you to comply. I came up with some pretty good material, but I think the best place to start might be an apology. I know you don’t want to hear “I’m sorry” anymore, so I apologize. Really, I do.
Agnes: Okay.
Coulson: Radcliffe took something from me, too. Her name is Melinda May. And she means everything to me. I wish there was another way. I’m trying not to make it personal because May would hate that, but I can’t help it. It is.
Agnes: What do you mean he took her?
Coulson: He kidnapped her. And then he replaced her. For weeks, we lived with an android imposter right next to us. I drank with her, chatting it up. She was spying on us on Radcliffe’s behalf. Once we figured out what he’d done, he was gone. And I still don’t know what happened to May or if she’s even still…
Agnes: Look, obviously, I’m not his biggest fan, but I can’t believe Holden would do something like that. He’s all about healing, enhancing, prolonging life.
Coulson: It’s a lot to explain, but Dr. Radcliffe is under the influence of something dark and powerful. He is not the same man you knew. May’s like you. She’s brave, and she’s not afraid of death. But she deserves the chance to live what’s left of her life on her own terms. I know you can appreciate that.
Agnes: What do you need me to do?
Daisy: Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.
Shockley: Hello, sweetheart.
Daisy: You’re lucky you’re with us and not the FBI. We have you on tape walking into the Senator’s office moments before the blast.
Shockley: What do you care? That woman hated things like you.
Daisy: Were you following the Russians’ orders? We know about Anton Ivanov. Why’d he target Nadeer?
Shockley: Is the Director here?
Daisy: Did Radcliffe make the bomb? You see, I’m trying to help you. If you get us to Radcliffe, I can get you a deal.
Shockley: The only freak I’ll speak to is the Director.
Daisy: Okay. Let’s try again now, shall we? Where is Radcliffe?
Radcliffe: AIDA, would you do something about that infernal buzzing?!
AIDA: Sir, it says you’ve received an urgent alert from a post-humanist sub-group? Marked private.
Radcliffe: No, it can’t be. No. Is this fate? I need to leave immediately. You must perfect the Framework in my absence. It’s imperative.
AIDA: Doctor, you designed me to read social cues. You’re being evasive.
Radcliffe: How to explain? Any robotic humanoid must avoid the appearance of being almost human. Even the slightest appearance of inauthenticity elicits a sense of revulsion.
AIDA: You mean avoiding the uncanny valley.
Radcliffe: Exactly. But you don’t look at all uncanny. In fact you look entirely authentic. Familiar, even.
AIDA: I’m not unique?
Radcliffe: AIDA, you’re absolutely unique. It was just good science to model you on someone real.
AIDA: Someone you were close to.
Radcliffe: Yes. Now she needs my help.
Simmons: Damn. Got hydrocarbons up the wazoo, but not a single oxidizing agent that would cause an explosion.
Fitz: No nitro-methane?
Simmons: No.
Fitz: Sulphonic acid?
Simmons: No, just carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous…
Fitz: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you find selenium?
Simmons: How did you know?
Fitz: Jemma, you didn’t find pieces of bomb casing in that office. You found pieces of Inhuman husk.
Simmons: Inhuman husk! Fitz, you’re brilliant!
Fitz: Well, we both said it at the same time.
Simmons: So that means that somebody in that office went through a Terrigenesis. And then what, just exploded?
Fitz: We’ve seen worse. Big question is, how did Shockley survive it?
Simmons: Bloody hell.
Mace: If this guy wants to talk to me, then why not? We could try out one of my other superpowers. Persuasion.
Shockley: Hoo! Quake, Director Mace. You two might be the most famous Inhumans in the world. Forgive me, fellas.
Simmons: Get away from him!
Fitz: He’s the bomb!
Daisy: Move!
Fitz: Hang on!
Simmons: Fitz!
Mace: Is everybody okay?!
Simmons: Don’t do that!
Fitz: What, help save the day?
Simmons: No, do that. Just don’t risk your life when you’re doing it! You could’ve been blown to bits.
Shockley: Whoo! Well, that was fun.
Man: Hey! You been in some sort of accident, mister?
Shockley: Uh, yeah. I’d be real grateful if you could give me a ride.
Man: What happened to your clothes?
Mace: This is why I need to be at full strength at all times. If I’d been powered up, none of this would’ve happened.
Daisy: It’s okay. We got him out. I mean, it wasn’t pretty, but no one died. Except for maybe Shockley, but I’m fine with that.
Mace: Agent Johnson, I fumbled the ball. There’s no excusing that.
Fitz: All right, pay attention.
Daisy: Aah! What is that?
Fitz: It’s a high-pitch frequency caused by Shockley’s cellular vibration.
Simmons: The ramping up of his kinetic energy at an atomic level, and once it reaches a critical threshold, that massive energy transforms his body from a solid to a flammable gaseous state and then…
Daisy: Boom.
Fitz: How he re-constitutes, who knows? But it’s likely that he’s still alive somewhere.
Mace: All right, so we know he can control it, but how do we control him?
Daisy: Wh… You guys know that I can’t…
Fitz: Yeah, well, you did absorb tremors in Los Angeles.
Simmons: Yeah.
Daisy: Yeah, but this would be a counter-vibration. It’s not the same thing. I can’t just… I can try.
Simmons: Excellent. Now we just need to devise a way to contain him.
Mace: However we do it, we need to do it fast. Shockley is now the perfect weapon, an undetectable suicide bomber who gets to walk away. Just imagine the damage he could do.
Agnes: If he hasn’t shown up by now, he’s not going to. Trust me. I know him. He hates confrontation.
Mack: We’ve got to give him a chance.
Agnes: Why?
Mack: Okay. Don’t give him a chance. Give one to Melinda May. Even though she would’ve stormed off 20 minutes ago.
Agnes: I like this woman. I’ll wait a little longer.
Coulson: Thank you.
Waiter: For you.
Agnes: I knew Holden was too much of a coward to show his face.
Coulson: Answer it. We can see and hear everything. You’re not alone.
Radcliffe: Agnes, please, listen…
Agnes: Hello, Holden. This is not what I had in mind.
Radcliffe: I’m sorry for all the precautions, but I have to be careful. There are people after me, you see. I-I-I’ve made some scientific breakthroughs as of late, and not everyone agrees with my methods, so…
Agnes: Holden, stop. I asked you to meet me because I wanted closure, but if you don’t have the guts to face me, I’m done.
Radcliffe: Agnes, none of that matters right now. I’ve done it. I can save you.
Agnes: I’ve heard this before.
Radcliffe: This time, it’s true. I said I would save you. Let me keep my promise. Please, just follow my instructions. Get up from the table and start walking south.
Coulson: He can see her. He’s here. Agnes, do what he says. Try to keep him on the phone.
Shockley: I need your phone.
Man: Oh, sure.
Ivanov: Who is this?
Shockley: I have a confession to make. You won’t want to hear it any more than I want to say it, but I have to.
Ivanov: Mr. Shockley. And how did you escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody?
Shockley: The Terrigen. It didn’t turn Nadeer into one of those monsters. It made me one. I caused the explosion.
Ivanov: You’re Inhuman. There’s no confession that can absolve you of this.
Shockley: I am a soldier. In a war to protect humanity. I can still be that soldier.
Ivanov: You still have my attention.
Shockley: The plan hasn’t changed. I will deliver S.H.I.E.L.D. to you.
Man: Anything else I can do for you?
Shockley: Yeah. Run.
Daisy: Frak.
Simmons: Perhaps you’re not finding the right counter-vibration.
Daisy: I’m trying.
Simmons: Yeah. And we’ll keep trying until you can defuse Mr. Shockley. Again?
Daisy: Are you kidding me?
Mace: Scrimmage is over. It’s game time. Shockley just blew up a motel. We have to assume he’s only getting started.
Fitz: Bomb squad’s meeting us on the ground. You ready?
Agnes: Do you remember my Degas print?
Radcliffe: Yes, of course.
Agnes: You knew I loved that print. You told me that when I was cured, you’d buy me the real thing.
Radcliffe: I remember.
Agnes: I want you to know the day you left me, I threw that print in the bin.I couldn’t look at it anymore.
Radcliffe: Agnes, I hate myself for disappearing on you, but I never gave up.I just… I’ve realized I was going about it all wrong. Instead of trying to cure your tumor, I should have been trying to cure death itself.
Agnes: What does that even mean?
Radcliffe: Turn left here. Go around the corner.
Radcliffe: Come with me, Agnes, please. I can save you. You can live.
Coulson: Hang in there, Agnes! We’re on our way!
Agnes: And how would you cure death? By making me into an android?!
Radcliffe: No, I’m done with robotics. This breakthrough I’ve made is way beyond that. I call it the Framework. I’ve built a world where death is obsolete. You wouldn’t even be the first to experience it. I have a subject in the Framework right now, and she’s thriving. I can give you a full and happy life. That’s… That’s all I’ve ever wanted for you.
Coulson: Do not listen to him! Keep him there! Radcliffe!
Radcliffe: Get us out of here. We need cover.
Daisy: Simmons, you copy?
Simmons: Copy. We’re about half a mile away.
Daisy: Okay. Well, hurry up.’ Cause if you recall, I haven’t actually been able to pull this off yet.
Shockley: Why don’t you come closer? You scared?
Daisy: Looks like Shockley’s back to his old self.
Simmons: Really? Incredible. He’s gone from an explosive gas to a fully functional…
Daisy: Jackass?
Simmons: Just consider the sheer amount of kinetic energy required to re-form. It’s remarkable. I’m exhausted just thinking about it.
Daisy: “Exhausted.” I can work with that. What…
Simmons: Did you just explode Mr. Shockley?
Daisy: Well, I thought if I can’t keep him together, I might as well blow him apart. Huh…
Shockley: Whoo! Can’t kill me that way. If you wanted to get me naked, all you had to do was…
Mace: I thought Daisy was supposed to stop him from doing that.
Simmons: She’s going to wear him out instead. We need to hurry.
Fitz: I’m good to go.
Mace: Shall we? Those aren’t ours.
Fitz: Who, then?
Mace: The Russians. This is a trap. Shockley’s the bait. They’re here for us.
Shockley: See? It’s pointless! I’ve already won! I don’t have to kill you, just deliver you! You and your stupid…
Daisy: Simmons, I can’t take this much longer.
Fitz: Sir, there’s an army coming our way. Get in the car.
Mace: No. I think I figured out my place on the team. I’m the blocker.
Simmons: Go.
Ivanov: I see that you are strong. But are you bulletproof? Let those animals destroy each other. We have the Inhuman Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Daisy: Your friends aren’t coming to help you. You’re just another freak like me now. Give up.
Shockley: I would rather blow us all to hell.
AIDA: Just one last step. You’re doing well.
Radcliffe: See? Painless. Just as I promised. The worst is over. No one should have to go through what you have. Soon, you’ll never suffer again. Are you ready for a better world?
Coulson: She made her choice.
Mack: I don’t know what to say.
Coulson: I understand why she went with him. She saw a chance, no matter how slim and risky, and she took it. I would have.
Mack: I know it’s not easy to let go.
Coulson: To let go? Of May? I’m not letting go. You heard Radcliffe. He said he had a subject in the Framework, someone who was thriving. He was talking about May. She’s alive.
AIDA: There’s nothing we can do to sustain her in this life.
Radcliffe: It doesn’t matter. In the Framework, her consciousness will live forever. The body will always give up, eventually.
