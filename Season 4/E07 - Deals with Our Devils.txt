May: What happened? I expected a crater.
Mack: So, no explosion. The room seems stable. Was it some kind of energy weapon? This all feels wrong.
May: No Fitz, either. I don’t get it. There should be some sign of them. It’s like they vanished. Coulson, Fitz, report in.
Man: Alpha Team, do you read? We’ve got movement. Eli Morrow is in the South Corridor.
Mack: Eli. Let’s see what he knows.
Agent: Mr. Morrow, we’re here to escort you out of here. He’s armed!
Eli: Beautiful, no? Pure carbon.
Agent: Sir, you have to put down the weapon.
Mack: We’re into nightmare territory here. This is evil. This is…
May: It’s Eli.
Mace: This is a tragedy. We have to prepare for the likelihood…
Daisy: Whatever you’re gonna say, don’t. I see the way you’re all looking at that screen. We don’t know what happened.
Mack: Daisy.
Mace: It’s okay. This is a process.
Daisy: No, it’s S.H.I.E.L.D. Impossible things happen all the time. That… That machine ghosted that Lucy woman.
Mack: So what? Coulson and Fitz come back in five years, bloody and insane?
Daisy: I don’t know. That’s my point. They could be stuck in one of those boxes or…
May: Or maybe they’re gone.
Daisy: May. I know it’s crazy, but Coulson came back from the dead, Fitz pulled Simmons through space through a rock, and Robbie’s head lights on fire.
Mack: Simmons.
Mace: We need to approach this with level heads.
Daisy: No, we need to call Simmons. She can solve this, if anyone can.
Mack: And she deserves to know.
Mace: Okay.
Mack: Why did Eli turn on us? What does he want?
May: What he wanted all along. A power. I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew to steal the box in the first place.
Mack: We need to take him off the street now.
Mace: No. Daisy’s right. Simmons needs to study this tech first, see what makes Eli tick.
Mack: He’ll kill again, sir.
Mace: Eli killed four agents with his mind. Go after him now, and you’ll make it five.
Mack: Those agents died for no reason.
Mace: And, hopefully, Simmons will give us a way to avenge them. And if we’re really, really lucky, maybe she’ll find hope for saving our friends. I’ll call her now.
May: Mace. When you talk to her…
Mace: I know what Agent Fitz means to her.
Doctor: Dr. Simmons, we need your help.
Simmons: Is that a Terrigenesis cocoon?
Doctor: Mm-hmm.
Simmons: In progress? Oh. It’s incredibly rare to see the actual metamorphosis. It only lasts a few fleeting moments.
Doctor: Not this one. The subject’s been gestating for seven months.
Simmons: Come again? How has he survived? Who is he?
Doctor: Classified. Agent Simmons, we’re not worried about who he was. We want to know what he’ll become.
Mack: I know you’re not okay, but… you okay?
May: What if Daisy was right and they’re not dead?
Mack: Where’s this coming from?
May: I have a feeling, can’t explain.
Mack: I know you’re hurting, but Coulson was clear. Do not open that book.
May: He didn’t know what was inside it.
Mack: He knew enough. It’s Pandora’s Box, and you don’t know the consequences.
May: Neither do you. This might be our only shot at saving them.
Mack: Melinda, don’t you dare.
Mace: You wanted to speak?
Mack: Yes, sir, I, uh… I think I’ve found a workable lead to track down Eli Morrow, from one of May’s better ideas.
Mace: Then let’s hear it.
Mack: Remember the head of the Chinatown Crew that ordered the heist of these boxes, Chen?
May: He got infected by Lucy, went through the same thing I did.
Mace: Until his brains hemorrhaged all over the lab.
Mack: Well, before that, he spent two years in South Ridge Penitentiary.
Mace: With Mr. Morrow.
Mack: Exactly. The Chinatown Crew was working with Eli when he was in prison. And now that he’s out, they might know his location. Now, I figure, if I find their hideouts, I find Eli, and then I can…
Mace: Slow down. We’re not gonna just go cracking heads.
Mack: It’s not cracking heads.
May: Let him go. Someone should.
Mack: Look, my job is to keep people safe.
Mace: Mine, too. So, first we sharpen the ax, and then we chop the tree.
Mack: My ax is plenty sharp and a shotgun.
Mace: We’ll follow your leads in due time, after we study this tech. The Zephyr is wheels up in five. Agent Mackenzie, there are four fallen agents who need to be prepped for their… For their last ride home.
Mack: Yes, sir.
Mace: You and I will ride ahead in the Quinjet, get this cargo back to base, max speed. Dr. Radcliffe will work on them immediately.
May: Simmons approved it?
Mace: I talked to her. It’ll take her a few hours to return. So, this way, we don’t waste any time.
Gabe: They were my closest family, and I didn’t know them at all. They both. I knew Robbie was disturbed, but… but I was afraid that was ‘cause of me… ‘cause I was holding him back.
Daisy: No, you… you were what he held onto. You grounded him.
Gabe: But I wanted him to leave. You know, figure himself out. I didn’t know that was what he was up against.
Daisy: Your brother loves you more than anything.
Gabe: I just wish we had talked. You really think he’s not gone?
Daisy: I know the feeling when someone’s gone, and I don’t feel that now. Plus, your brother’s pretty damn stubborn.
Gabe: You have no idea. If he is out there, he’s gonna go straight for Uncle Eli.
Mack: And he’d be doing the right thing.
Daisy: Mack, what are you doing?
Davis: Sir, you got to stop. Director’s orders. We’re about to take off any minute.
Daisy: Mack! What’s gotten into you?! Mack!
Fitz: Sir?!
Coulson: Yeah.
Fitz: You okay?
Coulson: Yeah. Where’s Eli?
Fitz: I don’t know. What happened?
Coulson: Eli locked himself inside, triggered the device, then everything just went white.
Fitz: Yeah, I got hit with the same blast.
Coulson: You know what it was?
Fitz: Best bet is this chamber’s some kind of of particle generator. I think we got hit with the fallout when Eli blasted himself.
Coulson: I feel okay. Was it radiation?
Fitz: No. I think we got lucky.
Coulson: I’d like to find Eli and ask him myself.
May: What happened? I expected a crater.
Fitz: Thank God.
Mack: No explosion.
Coulson: Yeah, well, I was pretty psyched about that. Eli triggered the Silo right in front of me.
Mack: The room seems stable. Was it some kind of energy weapon?
Fitz: No, it’s not a weapon, 'cause Eli used it on himself.
Mack: This all feels wrong.
Coulson: He got the knowledge from the Darkhold. We need to grab him.
Fitz: Do you think he was trying to enhance himself?
May: No Fitz, either.
Coulson: What?
Fitz: What?
May: I don’t get it.
Coulson: May, what are you…
May: There should be some sign of them. It’s like they vanished.
Fitz: Mack. Mack. Hey! Big man, over here! Over here! Hey!
May: Coulson, Fitz, report in.
Fitz: Yeah! Report! I’m reporting!
Coulson: May, I’m right here!
Fitz: Reporting! The blast must have altered our state somehow.
Coulson: You think? Wait. What are they doing? Do we look that stupid on comms?
Mack: Eli. Let’s see what he knows.
Coulson: We can’t lose them. Fitz, come on!
Robbie: I heard some troubling things from Lucy. You try to kill them? You were behind this the whole time!
Agent: Mr. Morrow, we’re here to escort you out of here.
Robbie: What did you do?
Agent: He’s armed!
Robbie: Tío, keep your head, man. Don’t do anything stupid.
Eli: It’s beautiful, no? Pure carbon.
Agent: Sir, you have to put down the weapon.
Robbie: Tío, don’t hurt them. Get away from him! I’m sorry. I couldn’t help them.
Mack: We’re into nightmare territory here.
Robbie: You can’t hear me, can you?
Mack: This is evil. This is…
May: It’s Eli.
Robbie: I couldn’t stop him.
Coulson: It’s not your fault.
Robbie: You can see me?
Coulson: Yeah, Robbie. We see you.
Robbie: What did he do to us?
Coulson: I hate watching my own demise.
Robbie: I don’t think we’re dead. I feel sick. My stomach hurts. And the lights are darker, right?
Fitz: The lights. Yeah. Their voices are hard to hear. They can’t penetrate wherever we are.
Coulson: What do you mean “where we are?” Do you understand what this is?
Fitz: I think I understand why Lucy and her friends looked like ghosts now. They were out of phase with our reality. It’s like the… the invisible quantum mechanics inside the boxes, moving in and out of our dimension. Lucy and her friends were stuck in between, and now we are, too.
Coulson: Trapped between dimensions?
Fitz: Yeah, that shock wave. That wasn’t turbulence… that was… that was… friction between two dimensions.
Robbie: Dude. What?
Fitz: Okay, imagine the world is a… is a raft floating on water, and Eli punches a hole right at our feet. We’re getting sucked down into… who knows what?
May: Or maybe they’re gone. May.
Coulson: Plus, we’ve been pulled further than Lucy ever was. We can’t affect them, or even our own environment. And wherever we are, they think we’re dead.
Fitz: Well, we may well be soon.
Mack: Simmons.
Coulson: Thank you, finally.
Fitz: They’re gonna tell her I’m dead. I’ve got to phone her, let her know that I’m in another dimension. That’s not gonna work. Oh, what’s she gonna think?
Coulson: Fitz, we’re gonna find our way home. Focus on that. We’re gonna figure this out.
Fitz: Yeah, okay, well, we better do it fast, 'cause whatever water we’re treading, we’re sinking.
May: I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew…
Robbie: The Chinatown Crew.
May: … to steal the box in the first place.
Robbie: I think they’re right about that. I can help find them.
Coulson: They’ll need to know we’re alive first. You got any hell-demon tricks up your sleeve?
Robbie: No. He’s fighting me right now.
Coulson: Then we’ll stick together, and we’ll find a way to make them hear us. All of us.
Mace: I’ll call her now.
May: Mace. When you talk to her…
Mace: I know what Agent Fitz means to her.
Robbie: Fitz.
Mace: Were you able to get Simmons on the line?
Burrows: They confiscated her phone. But I do have Senator Nadeer on the line, sir.
Robbie: Yo, Fitz, you’re a doctor, right?
Fitz: Uh, not exactly. Hold on.
Mace: They wouldn’t let us talk to her?
Fitz: They’re dealing with the Senator that hates Inhumans. How the hell did Simmons get mixed up with all this?
Mace: Senator, thank you for taking my call. Yes, we have a crisis brewing, and I know we had an arrangement, but, uh, I need Simmons to return immediately. Ellen, you have generously kept this situation quiet, and I thank you, but we’re past that now. I need Simmons back. Lives are on the line. Wait. What do you mean? Where is she?
Fitz: What situation? What have you done?
Mace: She hung up. Tell me you put a tracker on Simmons or something.
Burrows: We didn’t know we’d need one.
Mace: Damn it.
Robbie: Cold.
Mace: Keep working Nadeer’s people.
Fitz: Yeah. Yeah, it’s cold and heartless. I swear, if I get out of here, I’m gonna knock him stupid.
Robbie: No. I’m cold.
Fitz: What?
Robbie: I’m freezing.
Fitz: What happened?
Robbie: I don’t know. I need sunlight.
Burrows: Dr. Radcliffe, how are you?
Robbie: Warmth, anything. I’m dying here.
Fitz: Okay, okay. Okay, let’s get you warm.
Coulson: May, I need you to hear me. I’m not gone! May, help! Ahh.
May: You’re not allowed to be gone, not yet.
Coulson: No, I haven’t gone anywhere.
May: You’re not dead. After the Glasgow Assignment, we promised that we would open that bottle of Haig if we ever had a worse job. We’ve had 10 by now.
Coulson: I think Fury would rather have had us die than give up that bottle.
May: What the hell are we waiting for?
Coulson: Hey. I’m here. May, I’m right here. You can do this. Hear me, please. Yes. It’s me, May. I’m right here. The Darkhold. No. No, no, no. That’s not how we solve this. May. No.
Mack: I know you’re not okay, but… you okay?
May: What if Daisy was right and they’re not dead?
Coulson: Mack, do not let her open that book.
Mack: Where’s this coming from?
May: I have a feeling, can’t explain.
Mack: I know you’re hurting, but Coulson was clear. Do not open that book.
Coulson: Thank you. Someone listens.
May: He didn’t know what was inside it.
Mack: He knew enough. It’s Pandora’s Box, and you don’t know the consequences.
Coulson: Really? You’re not hearing this?
May: Neither do you. This might be our only shot at saving them.
Mack: Melinda, don’t you dare.
Coulson: What happened?
Fitz: I don’t know. He just doubled over. There’s nothing I can do about it.
Robbie: We’re being dragged down. He doesn’t want to go. He won’t go.
Gabe: But I wanted him to leave. You know, figure himself out.
Robbie: No! He won’t go!
Gabe: I didn’t know that was what he was up against.
Coulson: Who won’t go?
Robbie: It’s… It’s gone.
Coulson: What do you mean? Where did it go?
Gabe: He’s gonna go straight for Uncle Eli.
Mack: And he’d be doing the right thing.
Daisy: Mack, what are you doing?
Davis: Sir, you got to stop. Director’s orders. We’re about to take off any minute.
Daisy: Mack, what’s gotten into you? Mack!
Coulson: Did what I think just happened just happen?
Robbie: He’s going after the Chinatown Crew.
Daisy: Tell May what happened. And if we ever get the chance, never tell your brother about this next part.
Robbie: Oh, no, we’re way past that.
Coulson: Wait. What are you thinking? Don’t go.
Robbie: If I’m being dragged down to hell, this might be my chance to take Eli with me. Sorry, Coulson.
May: What’s going on?
Fitz: Oh, nothing. Just Mack’s the Ghost Rider now, but you can’t hear us, so… bloody hell.
Daisy: Pull over! What are you doing?!
Mack: What needs to be done! Don’t get in my way!
Daisy: Damn it, Mack.
Daisy: It heals itself. Scientifically impossible self-healing car.
Daisy: This isn’t over.
Mace: They’re out of their minds. They are out of their minds. Driving off against orders… With no helmet? Mack knows better.
May: Daisy will bring him in quietly.
Mace: See the younger Reyes boy gets some counseling.
Mace: Dr. Radcliffe, thank you for coming on such a terrible day.
Radcliffe: Now, Fitz, we can’t… You’ve met my assistant, of course. AIDA. We’re devastated by what’s happened to Fitz and the team. We’ve gotten to work straight away.
Mace: Good. Any progress?
Radcliffe: Sort of. These boxes look empty, but they’re not.
AIDA: They harness energy from multiple dimensions.
Radcliffe: Well, theoretically, could be used to manipulate matter states, transfer dimensional energy, but practically, it’s light-years beyond me. We will, of course, keep working.
Mace: We know, Doctor.
May: The people who constructed these boxes used this. A book.
Mace: Great. Comes with an instruction manual and everything. Well, please, get back to work. If you’ll excuse me, we’ve had some casualties, and I need to inform their families.
Radcliffe: Help me out here. A manual?
May: Uh, you… What’s your name?
Nathanson: Nathanson, ma'am. What can I do?
May: Get lost, Nathanson. I don’t know what it is. It’s supposed to have answers. I don’t know. But it worried Coulson in a way I’ve rarely seen.
Radcliffe: Very well. Let’s see what you are. What the hell is that?
May: Y-you have to read it. You’re the only one who can understand the science.
Radcliffe: No, there has to be another way.
May: There isn’t. If you won’t read it, I will.
Radcliffe: Listen, if I had ten years, maybe I could understand it, but… it’s too much for a human mind to bear.
May: You want to tell that to Simmons? I don’t.
Simmons: Listen to that. The heartbeat, and it’s fast, 130 BPM. He’s nervous. Lower the lights. Clear the room.
Doctor: What? We can’t do that.
Simmons: You will do that, because, despite the lack of respect I’ve been shown today, I assume I was brought here because your bosses value my expertise. So impress them by keeping me happy. Everyone out… now.
Simmons: Hi. I’m Jemma Simmons. I’m from S.H.I.E.L.D. And I’m here to help you. I know this is all frightening, but I have friends who have also gone through this. But it’s okay. I’m here, and we’ll get through this together.
Mack: I’d like a word.
Radcliffe: May. May, this is lunacy. If the Internet is a garden hose, this book is Niagara Falls, blasting the universe’s deepest thoughts through your eyeballs.
May: It’s a piece of technology, a tool.
Radcliffe: So’s a grenade, until it’s in the hands of a child. You can’t handle it. You’ll hurt yourself.
AIDA: Perhaps I could read the book.
Radcliffe: Absolutely not. No, no.
May: What’s going on?
Radcliffe: Aspirations of a do-gooder.
May: So? She’s a scientist and braver than you, apparently.
Radcliffe: Here’s the thing, AIDA’s not exactly my assistant. Or human.
May: What?
Radcliffe: She’s an android. So she is my assistant, but she plugs into the wall. So it’s like you say, she’s a tool. No offense, AIDA.
AIDA: None taken. I was designed to save lives, to be the shield.
Radcliffe: Shush! You’re developing a catchphrase. May, I can assure you she’s as aboveboard as a… secret android could be. Fitz-Simmons helped.
May: Then use her.
Radcliffe: What? But… do you think that’s a good idea?
May: You said I can get hurt. Can she?
AIDA: Only rebooted.
Radcliffe: If her files get corrupted. She’s a computer.
May: Perfect. Then it’s just a download. She’s the tech we need to save them.
Daisy: Well, this looks like the place.
Mack: It’s not ideal, but Mack, he has a lot of pain. He lost hope. I could survive off his pain for years. I know where you’re being dragged down to. I’ve escaped it before.
Daisy: Mack… You need to come with me.
Mack: I’m never going back.
Robbie: Please be careful with my baby. No, no. No, no.
Daisy: It heals itself. Scientifically impossible self-healing car.
Robbie: That only works when I’m the Rider.
Robbie: Come on, you’re gonna let that stop you? Daisy, we have to catch him, okay? Mack can’t control that thing.
Daisy: This isn’t over.
Robbie: Attagirl. That’s more like it.
Daisy: Move, move. Damn it!
Robbie: I’m running out of time. The Chinatown guys have a warehouse not far from here. Just go left, Daisy. Daisy, go left! Turn left! Turn left!
Daisy: Robbie?
Robbie: Oh, I love this car. Now go! Go!
Coulson: I think you were right about us being pulled to the other side. The darkness is closing in around us.
Fitz: Why did he stop reading the book?
May: You have to read it.
Coulson: Because he’s smart. That book is too dangerous to use. It should be locked up or burnt.
Fitz: Oh, come on! That’s defeatist.
Coulson: Excuse me?
Fitz: It’s surrender. It’s a death sentence. I’m not gonna do it to Simmons. Science can solve this. Science can solve this. Human mind. Oh, I am so thick. AIDA. AIDA, read the book.
Coulson: What are you doing?
Fitz: She can process it better than anyone. AIDA. Listen to me. Listen to me. Just understand what I’m saying, please. They can’t hear me. Maybe you can.
Coulson: Fitz, Radcliffe just said it himself. The human brain can’t handle that book.
Fitz: Yeah, well, she’s not human. AIDA, the book. Read the book. Read the book!
AIDA: Perhaps I could read the book.
Coulson: Huh. I’m sorry. What did you mean… “not human?”
Fitz: Because Radcliffe and I built her, okay? Her mind can’t be corrupted because it’s just programming. She’s a perfect fit.
Coulson: She’s a robot?
Fitz: An android. She can handle a quadrillion functions per second, and she can get us home.
Coulson: Fitz, that was not your call to make.
Fitz: Absolutely, it is. Whose is it? It’s not yours. You’re not the director anymore. I have just as much say in this as you do.
Coulson: What are you so angry about?
Fitz: Because you used to make decisions like that all the time, and then you stepped down.
Coulson: I did what was best for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Fitz: Everybody is trying to do their best to prevent another tragedy… like Lincoln. For you and Daisy, that meant throwing in the towel, but we built AIDA to protect agents like him.
Coulson: I didn’t throw in the towel. I ran an illegal spy agency using powered operatives on American soil. Do you think the President loved that about me? I had to step down so that you could all continue in S.H.I.E.L.D.
Fitz: You handed it over to a director who betrayed Simmons! He sent her off, God knows where! We were having an argument. Now she’s out there, alone, and I’m gone.
Coulson: Listen to me. He would never hurt her. Everything’s gonna be all right. We’re gonna make sure of that.
Fitz: All right, well, I need you in this fight, 'cause I got to get back to her.
Coulson: I’m in this fight.
Fitz: I hope I’ve done the right thing.
Fitz: The pages are blank.
Coulson: Not to her.
Simmons: Okay.
Vijay: Thank you. Thank you. It’s nice to meet you, Jemma Simmons.
Simmons: Yeah, of course. What’s your name? Aah! Aah!
Vijay: Jemma. Jemma!
Doctor: Thank you, Doctor. I think we’re finished here.
Vijay: Jemma.
Robbie: On your left. Fair enough. I can’t help you. Have fun.
Man: Please. I already told you where he is. What else do you want from me?
Mack: I want you to pay… with your life.
Robbie: Hey! Mack.
Mack: No. You’re smarter than that.
Robbie: You.
Mack: I’ve been a voice in your head all these years. Now, finally, we get to speak face-to-face.
Robbie: I’ve wanted you gone. But our work isn’t done. Eli is out there. We need to stop him.
Mack: “We?” There is no we. Your time is over.
Man: No, no, no. Please, don’t kill me!
Mack: Stay.
Robbie: We had a deal. You still owe me vengeance.
Mack: Your neighborhood is soaked in the blood I spilled for you.
Robbie: None of that matters if I don’t take down the monster behind all of this. Eli. He’s my blood.
Mack: He will meet me, too.
Coulson: It’s getting darker, like it’s pulling us down.
May: All right, guys, we can finish the assembly from here. Clear this part of the building.
Radcliffe: Alternating probe and coupling lasers, built exactly to your specifications at 593.5 nanometers.
Radcliffe: I’m building an inter-dimensional gateway with an android I’ve created. If this works, I could die happy.
May: We’ve put our faith in a robot who says she hears ghosts. If it fails, you might die quickly.
AIDA: They’re here. I promise.
Coulson: How is she doing that?
Fitz: I’m not even gonna pretend to know.
Coulson: May, I really wish you could see this.
Fitz: Coulson, watch out!
Fitz: Come on! Fight! You got to fight!
Coulson: I’m pulling!
Fitz: We’re running out of time!
May: Is she doing anything?
Radcliffe: I hope so.
AIDA: We’re running out of time.
Robbie: You can’t hold on to Mack’s body forever. He’s a good man. He doesn’t have vengeance in him.
Mack: It’s not ideal, but Mack, he has a lot of pain. He lost hope. I could survive off his pain for years. I know where you’re being dragged down to. I’ve escaped it before.
Daisy: Mack? You need to come with me.
Mack: I’m never going back.
Daisy: Mack, don’t do this. That’s not you. You got to fight it.
Robbie: We made a deal. I ain’t going nowhere.
Radcliffe: Ready, AIDA?
May: No, they’re in trouble!
Radcliffe: No! That would be a deadly mistake.
May: Hold on, Phil! Come on! Fight it!
Fitz: That’s it! Fight!
Coulson: Let’s go home.
Radcliffe: We did it, Fitz! We did it! We did it, Fitz! We did it.
Fitz: Thank you.
May: I knew you weren’t gone.
Coulson: I know.
Robbie: You’re right. I won’t survive this without you, but the truth is, you need me, too. We had a deal! How about a new one? Give me my vengeance on Eli. Settle my score, and I’ll settle yours. All of yours!
Daisy: Mack? What happened?
Mack: Robbie, that… that thing… He took it out of me.
Daisy: Are you all right? Some of those things you said… you… You said you were in pain.
Mack: No, it’s just a rough day. I’m okay.
Daisy: Good. Where’d he take it?
Mack: Hell.
Fitz: Mace, where is he? Mace! I know what you did. Where the hell’s Simmons?
Mace: Agent Fitz, it’s good to see you back. Simmons will be here in a moment.
Fitz: Yeah, well, I’ve heard that line before. I want to know where she’s coming from 'cause I heard you on the…
Simmons: Fitz? Where is he?
Fitz: Jemma? What?
Simmons: Fitz!
Fitz: Jemma.
Coulson: So, AIDA…
May: I know what you’re gonna say. I know you don’t approve.
Coulson: Not my call. But you promised you wouldn’t open the Darkhold. You broke that promise.
May: Damn straight.
Coulson: You know, when this is over… you and I have a bottle of Haig to open.
Daisy: Mack is still upstairs. I think he needs some time alone.
Coulson: Is he okay?
Daisy: Don’t know. Bad day.
May: And Robbie?
Daisy: He pulled the Rider out of Mack, but he’s gone, I think.
Coulson: I’m sorry.
Daisy: Yeah, well, what he did should count for something. Mack got a lead on his uncle, possible location.
Coulson: We’ll follow it up, make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else.
Daisy: Good.
Mack: I thought I’d be seeing you. And I know you’re not alone.
Robbie: Want to help settle my last score?
Radcliffe: ♪ I saved the day ♪ ♪ I saved the day ♪ ♪ Don’t be dismayed ♪ ♪ The friends we made ♪ ♪ I finally made… AIDA ♪ ♪ The friends we made ♪ ♪ Don’t be dismayed ♪ No, I’ve said that already. Uh, what else rhymes with “AIDA”? ♪ She’s not a grenade ♪ No. Ugh! AIDA, what else rhymes with “AIDA”? Huh? Parade… Oh, never mind.
