Coulson: Uh, Glenn?
Talbot: Chin up. Almost there.
Qovas: Still no word from our forces below?
Remorath 1: No, Commander.
Qovas: Then ready the missiles.
Remorath 2: Something has entered our docking station.
Qovas: A terran ship?
Remorath 2: The object appears to be human.
Remorath 2: You are now prisoners of the Remorath.
Coulson: So, what’s our play?
Talbot: You and I are gonna show these ETs who’s boss. Don’t worry. I can fix this.
Coulson: I really wish you’d stop saying that.
Fitz: Okay, so how much gravitonium did Talbot use?
Simmons: All of it.
Deke: Well, maybe it’s not so bad. I mean, he did just annihilate a bunch of Remorath warlords.
Simmons: But the side-effects of gravitonium are catastrophic. Ruby absorbed just a fraction, and…
Fitz: And it drove her completely insane.
Elena: Yeah, well, she wasn’t all that stable before.
May: Neither was Talbot.
Simmons: With his previous brain injury, I fear that Talbot will almost certainly suffer a major psychotic break.
May: We need to find them.
Fitz: Look, the Lighthouse only just came back online. It could be hours before all systems are fully functional.
Elena: Where’s Mack?
Piper: Went to make sure the threat’s been neutralised.
Mack: Not this again.
May: Mack, no! We need it alive. This thing is our only chance to find out what Coulson and Talbot are up against.
Coulson: Pretty sure we just left Earth’s atmosphere.
Talbot: Doesn’t matter what galaxy they try and run and hide in. We’re gonna show ‘em who’s in charge.
Coulson: I feel like we’re seeing this adventure a little differently. The gravitonium? Why?
Talbot: Because I’m our last hope.
Coulson: But what about the voices?
Talbot: Bunch of dead losers, raising a ruckus. Turns out, all they needed was a general to get ‘em in line.
Coulson: Wish I found that more reassuring. I’m a little worried about you, Glenn. It takes most people years to get a handle on their powers. You skipped the tutorial, went straight to big boss level.
Talbot: You got to quit worrying, Phil. I’m feeling fine, tip top. Even brought my best wing man with me. What these alien scumbags didn’t count on is squaring off against the two best military minds the world has to offer.
Coulson: No, they most certainly did not.
Qovas: You dare to approach my ship.
Coulson: How about letting your wing man take point on this? We’re here to negotiate a deal for Earth.
Qovas: The Confederacy already has a deal with HYDRA.
Coulson: Thing is, HYDRA doesn’t really speak for all of humanity. Or any of it.
Qovas: HYDRA spent years kneeling before me, grovelling at my feet, and only then did I offer assistance. Yet you sneak aboard my ship and have the arrogance to make demands?
Talbot: I think there’s a misunderstanding. See, this is my ship.
Coulson: Easy, buddy.
Qovas: Your impudent tone is only gonna…
Talbot: I said this is my ship! Seems like you got the weight of the world on your shoulders there, pal. That’s better. Now, you kneel.
Coulson: I’m not sure that’s the best negotiating tactic.
Talbot: I said kneel! Before me! This is pretty good teamwork, Phil.
Elena: Hey, I heard about today. You okay?
Mack: Yeah. It’s not the first creepy crawler I’ve had to go toe-to-toe with. No, I’m good.
Elena: Mack.
Mack: They’re waiting for me.
May: How many are on that ship?
Mack: He give us any leads?
May: Just promises to disembowel us.
Qajax: The Confederacy stood more than a thousand years. They will seek vengeance, making slaves of you all!
Simmons: Really wish we could happen upon some non-slave trading aliens.
May: Any idea why this one is more rabid than the rest?
Mack: Probably has something to do with this. I’m pretty sure this is the same stuff Kasius took.
Simmons: It must give them some sort of energy boost.
Qajax: You are not worthy of holding the odium.
May: Course it would have a dumb name.
Mack: What the hell’s that stuff do?
Qajax: The odium gives the power of the gods to those in final battle.
Mack: First of all, there’s only one God.
Qajax: It is glory through the spilling of blood. The taste of your enemy’s pain.
Mack: And God definitely doesn’t want you drinking that garbage.
May: Any way to know how it works?
Simmons: Not without opening him up. I’ll get right to it.
Talbot: Well, Not bad for a day’s work.
Coulson: Gotta admit, I’m impressed. Though the kneeling may have been a little over the top.
Talbot: Do not contradict me, Phil. This is war. First, we establish dominance, then we dictate terms, yeah?
Coulson: Just wanna make sure we’re on the same page. Maybe now’s the time to talk big picture.
Talbot: I’m gonna save the world.
Qovas: From whom? The Confederacy decides what you will and will not do. It will not stand idly by while you…
Talbot: Stand? Yeah, I don’t see any Confederacy members standing. You see anybody standing, Phil?
Qovas: HYDRA was never this foolish.
Talbot: Yeah, but where’s HYDRA now?
Qovas: Your ignorance astounds.
Coulson: That’s how they found us.
Talbot: Hale.
Coulson: Take me to her.
Hale: You here as a prisoner? I sold out your team.
Coulson: Yeah.
Hale: Well, it was the only option I had. Confederacy was done waiting for gravitonium, and without Ruby…
Coulson: I’m sorry for your loss.
Hale: I’ve been angry for so long. You know, every time I got passed over, ignored, talked down to, I just swallowed it. I’d tell myself I’d make it better for Ruby, but that anger, just… It was just always there, the hatred. In the end, all I did was carry out HYDRA’s agenda. I never even took a breath to stop to think about the… the gift that life had given me. I failed her. Ruby died for nothing. And it was all my fault.
Coulson: We could use your help.
Hale: No, I got nothing left to give.
Coulson: You’d be surprised. Seems there’s been a development with your Destroyer of Worlds project. Turns out, it’s a go.
Hale: Daisy Johnson went into the machine?
Coulson: Actually, it was someone a little more out of the box.
Talbot: I think it’s time you tell me about the rest of your compadres.
Qovas: I would rather die than betray the Confederacy.
Hale: There are six seats. Kallusians, Rajaks, Astrans all count themselves members. Obviously the Remoraths. And there are two other warrior clans.
Talbot: You? You dragged me away from my family, kept me in a hole for six months. Messed with my head. Why should I believe a single word coming out of your mouth?
Coulson: You have every right to be upset, but the Confederacy is still out there. She’s the only one who knows how they operate.
Hale: Look, what I did to you was wrong. But it was all to bring us to this moment. Humankind is in terrible danger and you… you’re the weapon that I was trying to build. You’re the only one that can save us all.
Coulson: What was HYDRA’s arrangement with the Confederacy?
Hale: To protect the Earth from being attacked.
Talbot: In exchange for what?
Hale: Resources, Inhumans, and gravitonium above all.
Coulson: Why gravitonium?
Qovas: Because its power is unlimited. It can bend space, build empires and destroy them.
Coulson: Couldn’t you just find a fun game on your phone instead?
Hale: Look, we need to renegotiate our deal with the Confederacy.
Talbot: I think maybe it’s time we started shaking some hands.
Qovas: Impossible. A Confederacy gathering is sacred. A ceremony dating back over five of your centuries.
Talbot: Well, as a military man, I’d hate to buck tradition. So why don’t you bring me up to speed on protocol?
Qovas: Even if the Confederacy were to grant you an audience, you have nothing to offer.
Coulson: But if it’s gravitonium your friends want, there he is.
Fitz: This is an outright disaster. It could take hours to re-wire this antiquated system, and by then, who knows what cosmos the Remoraths will have escaped to.
Deke: Yeah. Fixing old electronics was kinda my thing back in the day, in the future.
Deke: What are… What are you doing?
Fitz: What? It’s a thing. It’s a thing that people do to celebrate.
Deke: Not cool people. Come on, man, you’re better than that.
Fitz: Okay.
Deke: It just took Talbot flying out of here like some sort of a wizard, in order to be able to breathe fresh air again.
Fitz: Well, being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent has its risks.
Deke: Yeah, but that’s just it! I’m not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but for some reason, I’m still hanging around this rusty drain pipe.
Fitz: Well, you do have family here.
Deke: Yeah. I don’t think it’s that. Oh, well, don’t get me wrong. You guys are great. Totally not disappointments at all.
Daisy: Lighthouse, is anyone there? Over. Repeat. Lighthouse, this is Daisy Johnson, does anyone copy?
Fitz: Yeah… yeah…
Deke: Daisy… Yeah, we… we’re here, Daisy, sorry, we just had some technical difficulties.
Daisy: Deke, thank God you’re there. I’ve been trying to get through for 30 minutes. I’m flying in. What’s wrong?
Deke: We were under attack.
Elena: Where were you?
Daisy: May had me drop off Polly and Robin.
Elena: Lie! I know that’s not all.
Daisy: I’m not having this conversation right now, Yo-Yo. Coulson’s missing.
Elena: Coulson’s missing because of you! After all your finger-wagging, the same rules don’t apply to you?
Daisy: You are the last person who should be giving a lecture right now.
Elena: What’s in the bag? Is that what you abandoned us for?
Daisy: It’s none of your business. What’s wrong with you…
Elena: We needed you. People died!
Daisy: Don’t put that on me! What?
Elena: You wanna use powers now? Then I definitely win.
May: You done?
Daisy: May.
May: Satellite just picked up an object outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Piper believes it’s the Remorath ship.
Daisy: When do we leave?
May: As soon as the artificial gravity’s installed in the Zephyr.
Elena: She’s gonna get everyone killed!
May: We’re going to help Coulson. Either find a way to pitch in, or don’t be here when we get back.
Talbot: I appreciate the trim, but feels like a lot of pomp and circumstance, to me.
Hale: We need allies for whatever war is coming to Earth. Diplomacy is key.
Coulson: Maybe I should come along, help navigate any choppy waters.
Talbot: Best not to rock the boat. These snowflakes seem awfully precious about decorum. I think I’ll just take the alien.
Coulson: Okay, but remember, tread lightly. Try and get a feel for the room.
Talbot: I already told you, I can fix this. How do I look?
Coulson: Pretty cool, actually.
Talbot: I could probably get the boys to rustle you up one if you want it.
Coulson: I’m good. Not much of a robes guy.
Talbot: I’m leaving this man in charge. Anybody here disobeys an order, you’ll suffer the same pretzel logic your friend did earlier. All right, Chuckles. Let’s hit it.
Estella: The six all stand present. Let us unite, under the banner of one true Confederacy.
Crixon: Qovas, who is this intruder?
Qovas: This man hails from Earth. He has come to renegotiate terms of their protection.
Crixon: The terms have already been set. Why would we even entertain such derangement?
Talbot: Because you guys have been dealing with a bunch of weak amateurs. It’s time you met Earth’s mightiest hero. Me.
Deke: What’s in the bag?
Daisy: My mum.
Deke: Oh. I heard about your little dust-up. I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Daisy: I’ve been better. It’s like the universe keeps reminding me that I should never have come back from the future. Also, some creep put a bunch of lemons on my bed as some weird sort of prank.
Deke: Sounds like classic Fitz. Look, I, um, I feel like you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. I, on the other hand, I… I lived in the Lighthouse my entire life, only to time-travel into the past and still spend every single day of my life inside the freaking Lighthouse. So it’s like, even without Kasius gone, this place just has this leash that keeps pulling me back in.
Daisy: Well, I’m glad you’ve stuck around. Even if it’s a little crazy.
Deke: Maybe it’s not that crazy. I’ve been wanting to tell you something, since we’ve gotten… you know, I don’t wanna say closer but…
Daisy: You really don’t. Everyone who gets close to me ends up dying.
Deke: Me too. And that’s why I feel like we have so much in common.
Daisy: My mum…
Deke: No, I know, and…
Daisy: Lincoln.
Deke: Who’s Lincoln?
Daisy: Uh, Lincoln Campbell. He… He was the first Inhuman that I became close with. Fought at our side and he… he died. He died for me, really. Right when we were getting going, or, you know, getting good.
Deke: Well, sounds like you were really in love with this guy.
Daisy: Kind of still am. Which is why I… I can’t lose someone else. And Coulson means more to me than anyone. And if he goes…
Deke: No, no, no. We’ll… We’re gonna find a way to save him.
Daisy: Sorry, you… You were gonna tell me something?
Deke: Yeah, Fitz-Simmons are my grandparents.
Daisy: What? Wait, what?
Deke: I know.
Daisy: Are you serious?
Deke: Mm-hm.
Daisy: Do they know?
Deke: Yeah. Yeah. Cat’s totally out of the food sack.
Daisy: Oh, my God. That makes so much sense. You and Fitz are both so… You… You’re such special people.
Deke: Good. I… I was worried that it was gonna make things weird between us.
Daisy: Wait, why would it make things weird?
Deke: No reason.
Estella: This man is clearly a charlatan. No mortal being can wield the power of gravitonium. Especially not some human. I submit we strip him to rags, then put him to auction.
Qovas: That would be most unwise, Estella. He has somehow harnessed gravitonium within himself.
Estella: Even so, it has no bearing. This man is not of the Confederacy. He has no business here.
Talbot: Well then maybe it’s time you made me a part of your little secret society.
Crixon: Impossible! For centuries the Confederacy has had but six members. To add another would desecrate the order.
Talbot: This is like a room full of Democrats. You get your rules and your regulations. Who’s really in charge here?
Estella: This is a Confederacy. All voices are equal.
Taryan: Though Crixon is often considered the most wise amongst us.
Crixon: The fact remains there is simply no place for a human amongst us.
Talbot: Your mistake is thinking I’m still human.
Talbot: Well, it looks like there’s a spot for me here after all.
Fitz: Good job getting this assembled.
Mack: That it?
Fitz: Yeah. Guess we just built S.H.I.E.L.D.’s first space ship. Mack. I just wanted to apologise, for locking you up before. Really wasn’t my idea. I actually… I…
Mack: You went along with it.
Fitz: Yeah, well, we were trying to get ahead of the problem.
Mack: By having Yo-Yo execute a kid.
Fitz: Things got messy. But, uh… I mean, it was the only way that Yo-Yo…
Mack: When does killing become the only way? We’re S.H.I.E.L.D. Aren’t we supposed to be better than that? None of this would’ve happened if you would have just said this invincible nonsense wasn’t real. But instead, you and Simmons lit the match and now Yo-Yo’s responsible for a girl’s death.
Fitz: I’m sorry, Mack. I really am. But it’s not that simple.
Mack: Simple is how you live a good life. Not with your theories, or prophecies. It’s following the good word and doing the right thing every time. Simple as that.
Fitz: No. Not always. Because there are lots of instances in history where… where it was necessary to sacrifice the few, in order to save the lives of many.
Mack: Of course, you’d say that.
Fitz: Ruby was dangerous, and it got complicated and that is just the way it was. So, I’m sorry, if that doesn’t fit whatever narrative that you’ve built for yourself.
Mack: You need to look inside yourself and figure out what kind of man you want to be. 'Cause lately, what you’ve been? It needs fixing.
Daisy: What happened there?
Simmons: This Remorath ingested a substance that stimulated every single cell in its body.
Daisy: And what, its heart exploded?
Simmons: Rather macabre, isn’t it?
Daisy: Just you wait.
Simmons: Where did you get that?
Daisy: What matters is that we might be able to save Coulson, by combining that with my mum’s DNA.
Simmons: Oh, Daisy, this feels like we may be crossing a line.
Daisy: Then we cross it. Are you just willing to let Coulson die?
Simmons: It’s not that simple. There are moral implications.
Daisy: This isn’t a morality debate, it’s just a question. Are you willing to let Coulson die? Yes or no?
Simmons: No.
Daisy: Good. Then get to work. This is your top priority.
Daisy: We space ready?
May: Looks like we’re about to find out. You coming with?
Deke: Yeah. I just need to get out of the Lighthouse.
Davis: So you’re going on a space mission to a hostile alien ship?
Deke: Yeah. Well, I don’t have that many options.
May: This is Zephyr One. We’re all systems go.
Piper: Roger that, Zephyr. You are clear for take-off.
Taryan: You were right to bring this man here, Qovas. Truly he stands a giant.
Qovas: As always, you see wisdom, while the others cower in fear.
Taryan: A strength of our warrior breeding.
Talbot: I’m sorry, partner. I didn’t get your name earlier.
Taryan: No apology necessary, the honour is mine. I am the first-born Taryan, master of the house Kasius.
Talbot: Kasius. Well, that certainly has a ring.
Taryan: The way you handled yourself today was quite admirable. Though I fear your Earth faces a far more pressing threat than anything posed by our Confederacy.
Talbot: Is this the attack Qovas warned might be coming?
Qovas: It shall be the end of your planet.
Talbot: That’s why Hale had a deal with the Confederacy to fight beside us.
Taryan: The Confederacy never intended to honour this agreement, nor could it, even if it so desired, it was merely a deception to extort the resources from your planet before time ran out. Which now it has.
Talbot: What are you saying?
Taryan: Thanos, and his forces have begun an assault on your world, even as we speak.
Talbot: Well then, I’ve gotta get down there with the Avengers and take on this Thanos.
Taryan: Thanos’s strength is unrivalled. You will lose, even with your powerful friends fighting alongside you. Though perhaps there might still be a way.
Hale: Astronauts say the view of Earth from space changes you. That’s why I always wanted to be one.
Coulson: Malick had Project Distant Star running inside NASA. Why didn’t you go work for him?
Hale: Leadership had other plans for me. Really rolled the dice letting Talbot go out on his own.
Coulson: Not to mention, we have no way out if things go sideways. Artillery, I’m guessing.
Hale: Probably have enough firepower there to incinerate your entire base.
Talbot: It seems the situation is worse than we feared. The Earth is under attack by an alien named Thanos.
Hale: What about the Confederacy? Did they agree to help us?
Talbot: More bark than bite. I’m afraid we’re on our own, General.
Coulson: We have to get back.
Hale: And do what exactly?
Talbot: The only option left. Make me invincible.
Coulson: Excuse me?
Talbot: I struck up a conversation with this guy from the Confederacy. He tells me there’s untapped deposits of gravitonium under the Earth’s surface.
Hale: And you want to get it out and power yourself up more.
Talbot: Well, that way I can handle any threat the Earth faces. I can be the “shield.”
Coulson: Can we just talk about this for a second?
Talbot: No! You don’t get to call a time-out, Phil! Our very way of life is under threat!
Coulson: Which we will find a way to defeat. But gravitonium? It’s too dangerous, you could lose control!
Talbot: I’ve never been more in control! You know, it is just like you, to second-guess me. Or is it now that you’ve seen gravitonium’s power, you want it all for yourself.
Coulson: That’s not what’s happening and you know it.
Talbot: Do I? How many times have we worked together, only for me later to find out you weren’t being above-board?
Hale: Do you trust this Confederacy member who told you about the gravitonium?
Talbot: Yeah. Real straight shooter. Named Kasius. Said he has two sons of his own.
Coulson: Did you say Kasius? Glenn, you’re being played. You can’t trust him.
Talbot: The hell is wrong with you, Phil? First you question my capacity to handle myself, and then it’s our allies, who you begged me to make.
Coulson: I know it sounds crazy, but the alien running Earth in the future, was a Kasius. He’s our enemy.
Qovas: Kasius is the most noble family in the Confederacy. This man is clearly lying.
Talbot: So, what? Is this another angle you’re playing, Phil?
Coulson: Glenn…
Talbot: We are at war! A war we will surely lose if I am not the most powerful being in the universe.
Coulson: No. There’s gotta be another way. We can use this ship and attack…
Talbot: This is not a debate! I’m in charge here! You’re either with me, or against me.
Coulson: Obviously, I’m with you.
Talbot: Then kneel.
Coulson: What?
Talbot: I’m Earth’s last hope, Phil. Its true protector. The one who can save us all. Now, either you accept that or suffer the consequences. Kneel.
May: Artificial gravity engaged. Approaching Outer Atmosphere. Prepare for vertical burn.
Piper: Roger that. Vertical burn is a go.
May: Zephyr press to MECO. Thrusters at full.
Mack: Zephyr, shut down plan is nominal.
Daisy: I probably should have talked you out of this.
Deke: What? No, this is great. I… I’m going to space again.
Daisy: Thanks for coming along.
Davis: We’re approaching the Karman Line.
May: Nominal MECO. Main Thruster is no longer required.
Mack: Copy Zephyr. Nominal MECO. Main Thruster no longer required.
Piper: Prepare to be the first S.H.I.E.L.D. team in space.
Mack: In this timeline, maybe.
May: Looks like we did it, Control.
Piper: Roger that, Zephyr. Good work, you guys.
Mack: Time to turn on cloaking. Won’t be long till you reach the ship.
May: Copy that.
Fitz: Looks like the Zephyr’s in space.
Simmons: Because of your design. I know you’d rather be up in Control right now.
Fitz: No. It’s probably best I’m not. So, the Centipede Formula is functioning as what? Some sort of catalyst to unleash Jiaying’s regenerative properties?
Simmons: That’s the hope.
Fitz: You really think this is a good idea?
Simmons: What I think is the less we talk about it the better. Now unzip that duffel and get me a viable sample.
Davis: Approaching enemy ship. No signs of resistance yet.
Piper: That is one big ship.
Mack: Just remember, the minute the Zephyr docks, cloaking won’t matter. You need to be ready to move.
Daisy: Strike team in position.
Talbot: Quinn’s team originally found gravitonium at the bottom of one of his mines.
Hale: How did you know that?
Talbot: He just told me.
Remorath: Sensors indicate an unseen object has breached our hull.
Qovas: How is that possible?
Talbot: Cloaking. What is S.H.I.E.L.D. doing here?
Coulson: I guess, providing back-up.
Talbot: This is mutiny! You made contact behind my back.
Coulson: That’s not true.
Talbot: They’re here to do what? Take my ship?
Coulson: You’ve got this all wrong.
Talbot: You’re a liar! You’re a liar! Did you have any part in this?
Hale: I told Coulson not to do it, he wouldn’t listen to me.
Coulson: Also not true.
Talbot: Find the intruders and take them out.
Coulson: They’re here to help. What are you doing? Glenn, don’t do this.
Talbot: You have betrayed me for the last time, Phil. Whatever happens next is on you.
May: That’s a start.
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D. is not your enemy.
Talbot: All these years, double-crossing me. I should have known better. You quake and Coulson dies!
Daisy: What are you doing?
Talbot: S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t welcome here. This is my ship!
May: This is an alien ship. We’re here to rescue you.
Talbot: Rescue me? I’m the one that’s gonna save us!
Daisy: Then put Coulson down and we can talk about that.
Talbot: Agent Johnson, always in the centre of the storm. Maybe that’s because you’re the problem.
Daisy: If I’m the one you want, fine. I won’t resist. But first you have to put Coulson down.
Talbot: You and I both know you can’t be trusted.
Hale: I trust her.
Talbot: Why would you trust Quake?
Hale: Because she kept her word. When Ruby was infected with gravitonium, she tried to help.
Talbot: Infected? Ruby was weak. The gravitonium wasn’t intended for some itty-bitty little girl. It was meant for a hero, strong enough to handle it!
Hale: You need to take a deep breath and calm your mind, Glenn. You know what’s best. It’s best if you comply.
Talbot: Compliance will be rewarded.
Hale: That’s right.
Talbot: And so will your betrayal.
Talbot: Go ahead, fire that weapon, Agent May, and Coulson dies, just like Hale. Do you surrender, Agent May?
Qovas: What should we do with them?
Talbot: They’re prisoners of war. Treat them accordingly.
Coulson: It didn’t have to be like this.
Talbot: You were always the enemy, Phil. Only now I have the clarity of mind to see it.
Taryan: The Earth is no longer a hidden blue gem. It belongs to another now. And yet it still has gifts to give. I look forward to taking mine home.
