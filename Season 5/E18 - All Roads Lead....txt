Talbot: Complete the mission, soldier. Eyes on the prize. Be prepared. Nobody has to get hurt. Get in, get out. Complete the mission.
Mack: Hey, Talbot.
Talbot: Hey.
Mack: You looking for something?
Talbot: Unh-unh. I’m just like a ticking time bomb over here, huh? Sorry. Just I’ve been in a cell for six months. I’m just a little pent-up. Can’t sit still.
Mack: I can imagine. I wish we got you out sooner.
Talbot: Me too, son. Me too.
Mack: Hey, listen, if you ever want to talk about it or anything else…
Talbot: I can’t. No, I can’t do that. But, uh, but thanks. You know, just trying to focus on one task at a time.
Mack: Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, rest up. Doctor’s orders.
Talbot: Yeah. You got it. Happy to comply.
Fitz: Stop!
Ruby: Aww. But I’m enjoying myself. I don’t really get out much, and it does seem to keep you motivated.
Fitz: Okay. Let her go. You want this machine fixed, I need her help. Please. I’m engineering. She’s biotech. We’re a team.
Fitz: Hey. You okay?
Simmons: Yeah, I’m fine.
Fitz: You sure?
Simmons: I’m all right, Fitz.
Fitz: Okay.
Ruby: Aww. You two are adorable. I ship it. I really do.
Simmons: Do you have any idea of the consequences of what you’re trying to do? We’ve seen where this leads.
Ruby: Your little trip to the future? Coulson filled me in.
Simmons: Then you’ll know that you destroy everything, the entire planet.
Ruby: See, I thought your pal Daisy did all of that. You people really need to get your stories straight.
Fitz: Everyone that you care about will die.
Ruby: Not a long list.
Von Strucker: And it’s getting shorter. Found Anton, what’s left of him. He took a header out a window.
Ruby: Then someone else must be here.
Von Strucker: Not for long. I activated our copter’s signal jammer and set the fallen mechs to seek and destroy.
Ruby: You know how to reprogram them?
Von Strucker: I took one apart once. It’s a basic protocol but effective. They’ll hunt down and kill anyone they find.
Ruby: Show me.
Fitz: You realize that we have a choice to make.
Simmons: Yeah. Our hypothesis is being proven. We die, we break the loop. We don’t fix this, we stop them.
Fitz: They’ll kill us. I can’t choose anything over you, not even…
Simmons: I feel the same way. So…
Fitz: So we keep working, piece by piece. There’s a lot to do.
Simmons: Yeah. Very complicated. It will take a while.
Ruby: Hey! Pick up the pace, or I start removing body parts. Like I did to your friend.
May: You’re late.
Coulson: Hold up. Please. We didn’t have a chance to finish our conversation.
May: I said what I had to say.
Coulson: Melinda…
May: We have a mission, Phil.
Coulson: Good talk, Phil. Good talk.
Daisy: Okay. The mechs went into a system reset and sent a distress signal out. We traced it to a location in the Appalachian Mountains, and after some satellite imaging, we can confirm that this is Hale’s base.
May: It’s a decommissioned military bunker, which means it’s highly secure and way off the grid.
Daisy: We need to hit them hard and fast, knock out their defenses before they even know we’re there.
Deke: Lighthouse rules. Club ‘em from behind, you don’t stop swingin’ till they stay down. What?
Mack: You wearing body spray?
Daisy: May and I go in, we get the Gravitonium, get the queen off the board.
Coulson: Checkmate. When do we leave?
May: You’re not coming.
Coulson: I’m not?
Daisy: We just got you back, and I need you to stay here and quarterback. Mack, find Fitz’s schematics and start building the artificial-gravity system for Zephyr One.
Mack: Oh, please don’t tell me we’re going back to space.
Daisy: Not until we have to.
Deke: And me… ah, uh… you need me to, uh, back you up, or…?
Daisy: You literally just got shot. Why are you out of bed?
Deke: I’ve handled worse.
Daisy: Um, no. You stay here, help Mack.
Deke: All right, yeah, if that’s how you want to play it.
Mack: Awesome.
Daisy: Okay. Z-One’s wheels-up in five. Let’s go.
Deke: All right, people, you heard her. Let’s get to work.
Coulson: Getting good at this. You are.
Daisy: I have a feeling Professor Coulson was easy on his students. I should at least lose points for the mutiny on day one.
Coulson: For sure. But I’m throwing you some extra credit for a well-timed rescue. Give ‘em hell.
Daisy: Yes, sir.
Hale: What took you so long?
Lee: It’s Ruby, she’s…
Hale: Gone rogue. I know. She’s headed for the chamber facility. Get me Anton on the line.
Lee: I can’t, ma'am. He’s dead. I called in reinforcements here because his mechs went down. We picked these up right before they went offline.
Hale: We need to leave immediately. Ruby’s dead set on powering herself with Gravitonium. You saw what it did to Creel. He’s not better, is he?
Lee: No, ma'am. He’s much worse.
Hale: Mr. Creel, how can we help you?
Creel: You can’t. No one can. They won’t stop shouting.
Lee: Voices, he says.
Creel: They hate each other. Quinn likes to feel smart. But Hall’s smarter. But Quinn’s louder.
Hale: Quinn? Ian Quinn?
Creel: It consumed him. Franklin wanted revenge, but now he’s stuck with him, forever.
Hale: They’re inside the Gravitonium.
Creel: Their minds. Their rage.
Lee: Ma'am, he only touched it for a moment. If Ruby infuses herself…
Creel: To hell with her! What about me?!
Lee: General.
Creel: They want out. They want out! Get them out! Get them out!
Coulson: You making some progress?
Mack: Yeah, it’s coming along, but I got to say, the idea of the Zephyr flying to space still feels a bit out there.
Deke: Yeah, well, I’m not even gonna be born for another 50 years, so maybe rethink “out there.”
Coulson: Well, let’s hope it never happens, but if we can’t change things…
Mack: Always be prepared, yeah, yeah.
Deke: You guys need to relax. Daisy is gonna figure all this stuff out. What was that?
Mack: Dude’s got it bad.
Deke: Whatever that means.
Mack: You’re in love with her.
Deke: Sorry? What? No. Uh, no offense Mack, but I think your radar is way misfiring on this one.
Coulson: That was convincing. I believe him.
Deke: Thank you.
Mack: You confessed, you idiot. When you were hopped up on painkillers. Piper and I couldn’t get you to shut up about it.
Deke: No. That’s… Okay, guys. What, you’ve never heard that drugs can make you say stuff that’s a little crazy? Maybe that’s why drugs are bad.
Coulson: It’s obvious. I figured it out a while ago.
Deke: All right, well, it doesn’t matter. She hates me, anyway.
Coulson: Most definitely.
Mack: Yeah.
Deke: Just for grins, say I were interested in someone, anyone. How would I… Like, you got a good thing going.
Mack: Don’t look at me. Last time I saw Yo-Yo, she lied to me, locked me up, and ran off.
Deke: Coulson?
Coulson: Sorry, bro. Apparently, I’m incapable of expressing my feelings or letting people take care of me.
Deke: You guys are useless. It’s lemons, then.
Coulson: Come again?
Deke: Well, in my day, when you wanted to tell someone how you felt, you’d just save up your tokens, you’d buy a lemon, you leave it on their bunk. That’s… That’s a thing here, right?
Coulson: 100%.
Mack: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Coulson: When in doubt, get a bunch of lemons.
Mack: You should do that.
Talbot: Let me in, let me in. Anybody home? Ring-a-ding-ding. I’m gonna need every weapon in this fight. We better hurry. We got to be ready.
Daisy: It feels good going on offense for a change, you and me.
May: If I need one, I’ll take one. I’ve got some pent-up aggression that needs let out.
Daisy: You want to talk about it?
May: No, I want to hit.
Thomas: Agent Johnson, system check is complete.
Daisy: Go hot, wait for my signal. Thomas, initiate launch countdown. And try not to hit us on the way down.
Thomas: Copy that. 10 seconds.
May: Safety first.
Daisy: Always. Game on.
Lee: What was that?
Hale: Stop. Stand down.
Lee: Ma'am, what are you…
Hale: That’s an order. I surrender.
Daisy: And we totally believe you.
Hale: There’s no time for us to fight each other. I need your help. We all have to leave right now.
May: Help you? You can’t be serious.
Hale: My daughter took the Gravitonium and went to use Strucker’s machine.
Daisy: The Destroyer of Worlds.
Hale: She’s at the same facility your scientist friends are. Last I knew, they were alive. But if Ruby succeeds, you make no mistake, she will kill them.
Fitz: No, hey! Hey, wait!
Ruby: Since you were taking a while. Is this above your grade level?
Von Strucker: No, no, no, no. They’re S.H.I.E.L.D.’s best and brightest. There’s nothing they can’t do if motivated.
Simmons: Torturing us isn’t going to make us work any faster.
Von Strucker: Well, you didn’t seem to mind torture the last time we met. Electrocuting me. You two didn’t have wedding rings, then, either.
Simmons: Please. We’re doing what you asked.
Von Strucker: Move. Move.
Fitz: Okay.
Von Strucker: The infuser’s reversed. They’re gonna have to start over.
Ruby: You know, I only really need one of you. Two is starting to feel redundant.
Fitz: Hey, we’re working with very limited resources on a very old machine.
Simmons: Fitz! No! Stop it! Leave him alone! We’ll fix it! We’ll fix it!
Ruby: Hey. Eyes up. Look at me. Next time, it’s her. And I won’t use my fists.
Talbot: This kid likes her crimson crayon. Redrum. Redrum.
Polly: What is this?
Talbot: Busted. Hi. My name’s Glenn Talbot. You helped rescue me.
Polly: What are you doing in our room?
Talbot: Uh, right. Uh, I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t be here. You’re right. I know better. Uh, I just… I… I just… I couldn’t… I couldn’t help myself. I have a boy, George. He likes to draw, too. I just haven’t seen him in a long time. It’s just hard. I’m sorry. I just… I haven’t been myself.
Polly: I think we’re all a bit out of sorts these days. It’s a strange time.
Talbot: So, this is who all the fuss is about, huh? She can tell the future?
Polly: Sort of. She sees a lot, but it’s all out of order.
Talbot: That’s a pretty remarkable gift you have, young lady. You must have seen some incredible things. Now, now. There’s no need to be afraid of me. I’m Glenn.
Robin: You’re the General.
Talbot: That’s right. How did you know that?
Robin: I’ve drawn you.
Daisy:: There’s something wrong with him. Creel touched the Gravitonium and felt people in there.
Coulson: Franklin Hall.
May: Ian Quinn, too.
Daisy: We’ve seen it consume people, but apparently, it also absorbs their consciousness.
Deke: Is that even possible?
Mack: Well, assume the answer to that question’s always yes.
Coulson: How’s Creel doing now?
May: He’s barely hanging on, lost in his own head. We had to sedate him.
Coulson: We have to get him help. I owe him that much.
Daisy: And we will, but right now, we have to stop Ruby.
May: According to Hale, Fitz and Simmons have been spotted on site.
Mack: Damn it, Yo-Yo. If that crazy Hydra girl powers herself…
Deke: Daisy, you can’t go there. That’s too dangerous.
Daisy: For the hundredth time, I’m not gonna quake the world apart.
Deke: That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying you have to be careful, because…
Daisy: No matter what, I’m not gonna use my powers around the Gravitonium.
Coulson: If you won’t quake and Ruby’s powered, she’ll kill you.
Daisy: Sir, you brought me back to lead. This is what that looks like.
Coulson: You can’t put yourself at risk like that.
May: We’ll make those decisions, Phil, not you.
Daisy: Look, we need every advantage we can get, so go through Robin’s drawings and see if there’s anything we can use.
Deke: Women, huh?
Mack: Shut up, lemons.
Talbot: Who is this? And when does this happen?
Polly: That’s not really how it works.
Robin: Soon.
Talbot: Soon. And these? These all come true? We need to act on this. There are people who want to meet you. There are people who want to meet you.
Polly: Robin’s getting tired. Maybe we could chat about this tomorrow.
Talbot: No, tomorrow… tomorrow’s too late. The mission’s… The mission’s today. The mission is now. I’m really sorry about this.
Polly: Go, Robin! No! Robin, get out of here!
Talbot: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Polly: Go! Get help, Robin…
Talbot: Just go to sleep. Shh, shh, shh. That’s it. Shh, shh, shh. Just go to sleep. Shh. Go to sleep. You’re coming with me.
Robin: I know.
Daisy: Our scans show a number of mechs outside the facility. Take them out, secure the perimeter. Only Agent May, Hale, and I will be going in, and if this goes sideways, be ready to evac. Now gear up.
Hale: Coulson taught you well.
Daisy: Just never gave up on me.
Hale: Promise me you won’t hurt Ruby.
Daisy: Not unless I have to. It isn’t her fault she is the way she is. She’s driven. She’s a great fighter. And with the right guidance, she could make a really good agent.
Hale: S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. You’re not serious.
Daisy: We’re about to need all the help we can get.
Hale: Tell me what I can do.
Daisy: If we are too late, you will need to talk her down. We can’t let things get out of hand.
Hale: Of course. I just want Ruby to be okay.
May: You ladies about finished?
Simmons: You okay? It hurts? It’s okay.
Von Strucker: A plane just landed.
Ruby: My mother?
Von Strucker: S.H.I.E.L.D. I sent the mechs to engage. That’ll buy us a little time.
Ruby: All right, where should I start? An arm? Maybe a leg?
Fitz: No, don’t, don’t. We’re finished, okay?
Von Strucker: It’s ready.
Ruby: Yes.
Ruby: What?
Fitz: Hey, we did as you asked. We fixed the chamber.
Ruby: But?
Simmons: In our experience, Gravitonium is not easy to manipulate. And we can’t move it into the machine.
Fitz: Wait. Hold on. That’s… That’s out of our control.
Simmons: Yeah, Gravitonium is unpredictable. There’s still so much that we don’t know.
Fitz: Hey, please. Please. You can’t do this.
Ruby: I’m done having people tell me what I can do.
Ruby: You were saying?
Fitz: Jemma, did you see that?
Simmons: That’s different.
Coulson: It’s not a bird, it’s a plane.
Mack: Oh, give me a break. It looks nothing like the Zephyr.
Deke: You guys arguing over drawings? Welcome to my entire childhood.
Mack: Look, we’re wasting our time. Why don’t we just ask her what these crayon doodles mean?
Coulson: You can go down there, but ask Deke. Robin’s a seer, not really a teller. Hey. What’s with Robin’s floor? Is that paused?
Coulson: Polly? She’s breathing.
Deke: Where’s Robin?
Coulson: We’ve been breached. Someone must have infiltrated the Lighthouse.
Mack: He took her. Talbot took Robin.
Coulson: No. He wouldn’t.
Mack: Earlier, I saw him. He… He was messing with the feeds. And he mumbled something. Said… Said he was happy to comply.
Coulson: HYDRA had him for six months. How could I have missed it? We have to find him.
Deke: I’ll stay with her.
Von Strucker: You did it.
Ruby: We did it.
Von Strucker: Ruby!
Ruby: Get me out!
Von Strucker: Ruby! No! No, Ruby!
Hale: Ruby!
Von Strucker: Ruby! What did you do?! You’re killing her!
Simmons: No, this isn’t us! We tried to warn her!
Von Strucker: You sabotaged the chamber!
Hale: No, it’s not the machine! Shut it down!
Hale: Are we too late?
Fitz: I don’t know. She only took in 8% of the Gravitonium.
Hale: Ruby!
Von Strucker: It’s okay. Hey, hey.
Ruby: Oh, they’re screaming! They’re fighting.
Von Strucker: I’ve got you.
Ruby: Help me.
Von Strucker: I’m not going anywhere.
Ruby: I didn’t mean to. Oh, God.
Hall: Get out!
Ruby: No! No! Get out of me! Please make them stop!
Fitz: Make… Make… Make who stop?
Ruby: All of them! Just please… please put me back in the machine! Get it out of me!
Simmons: We can’t. It only works one way.
Ruby: You lie! You always do this!
Simmons: Please!
Hale: Ruby, put them down.
Ruby: Experimentation without consequence.
Hale: It’s Mom. Look at me!
Ruby: Mum. There’s something really wrong.
Hale: I know. We’re trying to figure it out. Just stay strong, sweetie. Don’t panic, just try not to panic, okay?
May: They can’t be here. I’ll get them past any mechs.
Daisy: Come back. I’ll need you.
May: Okay.
Hale: It’s okay.
Ruby: No. N-o-o-o-o!
Coulson: Talbot, stop.
Mack: Drop it!
Talbot: You drop it! Stand down!
Coulson: Everybody calm down. Glenn, look at me. Why are you trying to get into the hangar? What are you doing?
Talbot: A soldier never questions his orders. Soldier always completes his mission.
Coulson: This isn’t a mission. This is Hale. She got into your head. She brainwashed you.
Mack: Robin, it’s gonna be okay, sweetheart…
Talbot: Don’t you talk to her!
Coulson: The HYDRA compliance program goes all the way back to Whitehall.
Talbot: You’re trying to get in my head. You’re trying to confuse me with that HYDRA jibber-jabber.
Coulson: You saw what they did to Creel, how hard you had to work to break his programming.
Talbot: What the hell do you know?
Coulson: I know you’re my friend. And you’d never kidnap a little girl.
Talbot: Kidn… Kidnap? That… That’s a hell of an accusation, Phil. I got a job to do.
Mack: She’s not much younger than your kid. Think about your son, Talbot.
Coulson: Think about it. What if that was George? You know this is wrong.
Talbot: Shut up! You shut your damn face!
Coulson: It’s not too late to turn back.
Talbot: No. My compliance is my reward, and I must be… I must be rewarded.
Coulson: Ignore that. That’s the programming talking, not you. Fight it. You can beat it.
Talbot: I can’t! I can’t. I can’t complete the mission. I gotta… I got to stop myself.
Coulson: That’s right.
Talbot: There’s only one course of action.
Hale: Honey, just listen to my voice.
Ruby: Listen to you, listen to them! Listen, listen, listen!
Hale: Remember your training. We’ll get through this.
Ruby: I can’t control it. It’s like I’m being ripped apart.
Daisy: Ruby, I have been right where you are, and I know that it seems impossible right now, but you will overcome this.
Ruby: No.
Daisy: Believe me.
Ruby: They’re too loud. They’re trying to take over!
Daisy: Just focus. Breathe. Stay calm.
Ruby: It’s too late.
Hale: No. Daisy’s right. She’s been through this.
Ruby: Daisy. It’s always Daisy!
Daisy: Try not to lose control, okay? Your powers will only get more dangerous.
Ruby: Everything powerful is dangerous.
Elena: Melinda.
Simmons: Your arm.
Elena: It’s fine. What happened? Did someone go in?
May: It’s being handled. We need to get to the Zephyr.
Elena: Handled by whom? Daisy.
Coulson: Talbot, stop. Don’t do this.
Talbot: It doesn’t matter, anyway. I’m not the same, Phil. I can’t trust my thoughts. There’s no other way.
Mack: Robin, come here, come on. Come on.
Talbot: Phil, tell George I’m sorry.
Coulson: Put the gun down.
Talbot: I can’t!
Coulson: Your compliance will be rewarded.
Talbot: You’re just trying to trick me. That’s the program.
Coulson: What’s best is you comply. Put the gun down.
Talbot: I can’t!
Coulson: Then turn the gun on me. You will comply. Turn the gun on me.
Ruby: You know, for a long time, you were everything that I wanted. You were my hero. And now look at us.
Hale: Ruby, let her go.
Ruby: I am more than you will ever be.
Daisy: Ruby, I am not here to fight you. You need help.
Ruby: I don’t want your help! I want to crush you.
Hale: Ruby, that’s enough! That’s enough! You listen to her. She is on your side.
Ruby: Then why aren’t you?! Mum, face it, I was never good enough for you.
Hale: No, all I ever wanted was for you to reach your true potential. I’m sorry. I pushed you too hard.
Ruby: Mum, this was a mistake.
Hale: No. My daughter is not a mistake.
Daisy: Yo-Yo, get out of here.
Hale: I promise you, we’ll get through this. Okay, just breathe…
Elena: That’s who took my arm.
Hale: No, Ruby.
Elena: It’s her, isn’t it? She’s the Destroyer.
Daisy: Yo-Yo, she’s a kid. She is terrified.
Hale: No, you look at me, listen to me. Stay with me, and we’ll get through this!
Ruby: No, Mum, they’re getting louder! ♪ Oh, I’m losing… Let us out. We want out. Let us out. I won’t be able to resist.
Quinn: Do it!
Hale: I can make this better, I promise! Ruby. What? Ruby? Ruby! No!
Daisy: No. Yo-Yo, what did you do?!
Hale: No. No. No! No! Ruby. Ruby.
Elena: Simmons.
Fitz: Where’s Hale?
May: How did she get away?
Simmons: And what happened to Ruby?
Daisy: I had it under control. She was coming around, and then Yo-Yo killed her.
Elena: No. I just saved the world.
Hale: Qovas. Qovas!
Qovas: Coming here without invitation? You are aware of the punishment.
Hale: I found what you’re looking for.
Qovas: My Gravitonium.
Hale: S.H.I.E.L.D. has it.
Qovas: Then you failed. Perhaps our deal has reached its end.
Hale: I can tell you where they’re hiding. But they won’t give it willingly.
Qovas: You’d have me kill them?
Hale: I have no reason to stop you.
