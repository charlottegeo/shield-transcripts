Ruby: Sure. Why wait for me to answer your knock when you can just walk right on in?
Hale: And why put your phone down when you can just be a brainless, drooling moron?
Ruby: I always look forward to our chats.
Hale: Ears, please. They’re saying you skipped class yesterday.
Ruby: I wasn’t in the mood.
Hale: Oh, Ruby. I expect better from you, okay? This behavior’s not acceptable.
Ruby: Well, you’re always telling me to stay true to myself, so what if I said my true self couldn’t care less?
Hale: Then I’d say get your ass to class. Otherwise, you’re gonna lose your damn screen time.
Ruby: Sorry, Mom.
Hale: How about I bring us some breakfast, huh? We haven’t done that in a long time.
Ruby: No, thanks, but if I do turn 11 again, you got it. Hey, Mom. Are you a good guy?
Hale: Where’d that come from?
Ruby: Well, you’re off to a strategy meeting, right? How to stop S.H.IE.L.D.? But up until recently, everyone rooted for them and thought that they were the good guys, so are you sure that you’re not a bad guy?
Hale: You’re obsessed with Daisy Johnson. Quake. My orders are to capture her.
Ruby: Not kill?
Hale: Ruby, this is my assignment, okay? And in the adult realm, we all have to answer to someone. Even me. I do what I must…
Ruby: What I must to build a better world for the downtrodden citizens.
Hale: For you, Ruby. I do this for you, okay? So try to remember that. When they resurface, I’ll put an end to all of this. This entire S.H.I.E.L.D. chapter will be over.
Fitz: Ah. Well, that was a hell of a thing.
Coulson: I’m so glad you guys made it.
Elena: Why are we still in the Lighthouse?
Mack: Maybe Flint’s Monolith didn’t work.
May: So we find them, try again.
Fitz: No, it worked. It takes you through time, but to the same place. I’ve been here before with Enoch. We made it.
Simmons: We’re home?
Fitz: Yeah.
Coulson: Oh.
Simmons: Oh, we’re home.
Fitz: I’m gonna try and find some light.
May: It’s hard to believe we’re back.
Mack: Find me a double cheeseburger, I’ll believe it.
Stoner: Welcome to the Lighthouse, the world’s last bastion against the encroaching darkness. If you’re here, you understand the gravity of the situation. The world as we know it has come to an end. My name is General Rick Stoner.
Coulson: Rick Stoner? I’ve heard of him.
Stoner: As you know, certain world events, should they occur, trigger what we in S.H.I.E.L.D. call Project Reclamation. This protocol was created as a black-ops action made only known to the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. Once initiated, Project Reclamation is conducted through secure communications we call electronic mail. Our Agents were instructed to gather you, the selected elite, from a host of nations and bring you here…
Coulson: Must have never been initiated. The 1972 Hydrogen Wave Crisis was averted.
Fitz: And, what, people just forgot about this place?
Coulson: There’s nothing in Fury’s toolbox about it. Mack, those injuries need to be treated.
Mack: I’m fine.
Simmons: I’ll decide that.
Elena: So will I. Well, I’ll be there while she decides.
Simmons: Let’s find a medical station.
Elena: Maybe have Simmons look at you, too, Coulson. That’s a bad cut.
Coulson: We can worry about it later.
Simmons: Actually, I wouldn’t mind checking everyone out. We did just experience an unexplored phenomenon.
Coulson: Worry about it later. You look after Mack. I’ll stay here with Daisy. When she wakes up, she’ll have questions.
May: When she wakes up, she’s gonna want to kill you.
Stoner: I see you’ve all brought belongings. Let’s place the non-essentials in the basement storage facility. There, you will also find the latest state-of-the-art technology that S.H.I.E.L.D. can offer.
Coulson: Good. We need communications. May, why don’t you take the tour?
May: Got it. Follow me. This way.
Stoner: See? Here I am, over here.
May: Fitz, you’re with me.
Daisy: You ICE’d me.
Coulson: Yeah, I was kind of hoping you’d forget that part.
Daisy: Sorry to disappoint. It looks the same, but we’re… we’re home, aren’t we?
Coulson: Did you really think after everything we’ve been through, you and me, that there was any universe in which I left you behind?
Daisy: Even with all of the risks that…
Coulson: Don’t care. I need you here.
Stoner: This S.H.I.E.L.D. technology should make you think the 1980s got here a bit early.
Fitz: Okay. Not really a “dream come true” scenario. There’s stuff here we can use with some adjustments.
Stoner: Now, don’t stand there gawking. Please follow me into the next room to deposit your valuables in the provided lock boxes. And you in the back, try to keep up.
Fitz: What is it? Oh. That’s quite unsettling.
May: Where did they come from? Unknown.
Noah: Ah. Perhaps I should not have startled you. Hello. I’m Noah. I’m a sentient Chronicom from a planet which revolves around a star in the constellation…
Fitz: Cygnus.
May: Got it.
Fitz: You’re a Chronicom?
Noah: I am.
Fitz: Did you know Enoch?
Noah: I did. He is the one who alerted me to the presence of this place. I’m glad to see you made your return journey safely, Agent Fitz.
May: Why are you here? Why are they here?
Noah: This bunker was built with extensive fallout shielding. Ergo, a secure place to store unsafe items.
May: These Monoliths are more than unsafe. No one should get anywhere near them.
Noah: The other deciding factor. Everyone who knows about this bunker is now inside of it. So the world is protected from these Monoliths, and they are protected from the outside world.
Fitz: So the outside world up there is still safe, normal and all that?
Noah: For now, though we are watching very closely. Follow me upstairs. I’ll show you.
Noah: Here, we can monitor any unusual activity anywhere on Earth. We Chronicoms monitor the line between the world and a stranger world.
May: Yeah, you monitor it and do nothing about it.
Noah: Yes, we observe without interfering, unless there is…
May & Fitz: An extinction-level event.
Fitz: Yeah, we got it.
May: Yes, we know that story.
Fitz: What are you observing now?
Noah: Various potential threats. You’d be surprised how frequently S.H.I.E.L.D. is mentioned.
May: We have a small but active fan base.
Noah: There are several events of note. A well-known politician attempting to delete his FBI files. An Asgardian spotted in the city.
May: What’s this one?
Noah: Potential alien contact. Why? Does this event mean something to you?
May: Yeah. I think it does.
Coulson: A light from the sky.
May: Figured you’d be interested.
Coulson: This is what Voss warned me about. If he’s right, then this is where it all starts, hell on Earth.
Mack: And we’re back.
Coulson: How long since it first appeared?
Noah: It showed up a few weeks ago, then appeared intermittently for some time after.
Elena: You think it’s alien?
Noah: The wavelength is unusual.
Simmons: Showed up where? Where was this?
Noah: St. Louis, Missouri.
Coulson: Well, guess we’re going to St. Louis, Missouri.
Fitz: Hunter and I left the Zephyr cloaked just outside of town. I’ll show you where it is.
Daisy: Great. But I’m not going.
Simmons: What?
Daisy: If I’m responsible for ending the world, I’d rather not get near one of the first omens. Hard pass.
Coulson: We could use you out there.
Daisy: I’ll be more useful in here. I’ll run back end on the mission with all of Noah’s dope-ass equipment. Dope-ass is a… it’s a good thing.
May: So, what do we do? Just walk out the front door into town?
Mack: Well, we are wanted. After what Fitz said about General Hale’s task force, we need to be covert.
Noah: You will be. The Lighthouse has a few covert entrances.
Simmons: This place has secret tunnels, like an Agatha Christie novel.
Mack: More like “C.H.U.D.”
Noah: There are a few tunnels, but this one takes you underground to the charming, little town of River’s End. From there, it is up to you.
Coulson: No time like the present. Let’s go.
Fitz: We really are home.
Coulson: We have to get moving. How about that one, Mack?
Mack: Sure.
Elena: Here comes the catch.
Mack: But there’s a catch.
May: Come on. We’re damn spies.
Simmons: I think it’s admirable of him.
Coulson: We’ll return the van when we’re done. No stealing, I promise.
Daisy: If I’m gonna be holed up here for a while, it’s good to know that it’s fortified. It’s kind of the perfect place to hide out.
Noah: You are typing with my keyboard. Which is fine. It does not bother me, even though you did not ask. But why are you typing?
Daisy: I’m setting up an alert. Even though my friends have been out in the world for like four minutes, it’ll let me know if one of them is spotted.
Noah: It has been much longer than four min…
Daisy: Dramatic effect, Noah.
Coulson: These things look roomier from the outside.
Mack: It’ll get us where we need to go.
May: Hey, could be worse.
Simmons: True. We could be enslaved by an alien sociopath in a dystopian future.
Mack: Or we could be trapped inside a virtual-reality fascist state.
Fitz: Or stuck at the bottom of the ocean.
Elena: Or stopping a crazy robot lady.
Simmons: Or falling out of a plane.
Mack: Fighting Daisy’s mom.
Coulson: Or fighting Daisy’s dad.
May: Or dancing.
Daisy: Wait. We’re not just wanted. We’re most wanted. Top of the lists. All the lists.
Noah: Yes. It seems you are the object of much interest right now.
Daisy: Every local P.D. has our picture, which means to anyone with a badge, we’re famous.
Coulson: Everyone just stay calm.
Mack: Hi, officer. Is there a problem?
Officer: Hey, you tell me.
Mack: Oh, this right here. Um, I was sparring.
Officer: No, I mean the van. This is John Nickel’s van.
Mack: Yeah, yeah.
Officer: I mean, is it a clunker or what? ‘Cause he’s been trying to sell it for months. Hey, be honest how badly did he fleece you on this?
Mack: Oh. Are you kidding me? You know how long I’ve been looking for a 1975 T2 1600 engine with shag carpeting? John’s price was more than fair. It was a steal.
Officer: First time for everything, I guess.
Mack: Yeah.
Officer: You guys have a great day.
Coulson: You too.
Mack: Thank you. That’s closer than I would’ve liked.
Coulson: We’re lucky this is a quiet, simple town. If we don’t make any noise, we can keep it that way.
Deke: Oh, boy. You got to be kidding me. Not from here.
Woman: Hey, I get it. It’s a pretty tree.
Deke: Yeah, I’ve never seen anything like it.
Woman: Yeah, that’ll probably stop when whatever you took wears off.
Deke: Hey, I got some of it right. Barkeep. I’d like to try a beer, a real one, please.
Bartender: One real beer. You got it.
Deke: Mm. Oh. God! That does not taste like it looks. Do you have anything else that’s like this but delicious?
Bartender: Yeah.
Deke: Mm.
Deke: Oh.
Bartender: I just need you to settle up, buddy.
Deke: Oh. Right. Yeah, settle up what?
Bartender: Your tab. You forgot to pay. Ah!
Deke: Right. Okay, sorry. Here you go.
Bartender: We take credit cards or cash. Whatever works best for you.
Deke: Right. Credit cards or cash, ‘cause that’s how people pay for things here, now, here. Okay. Ohh!
Bartender: Dude.
Deke: No, it’s okay, man. I’m from the future.
Coulson: How do you feel?
May: Like I’ve never loved gravity more. Hey. Maybe you should have Simmons take a look.
Coulson: I’m fine. Just a headache.
Fitz: Sir. I think we found something.
Coulson: You got a location where that light is pointing?
Simmons: It’s an Aerospace Industry’s laboratory. Just seemed a bit serendipitous.
Fitz: Yeah, so it got me thinking. We were assuming we were seeing a light coming down from the sky.
Coulson: But we’re not.
Fitz: Well, it looks like that because of the frame rate. It’s like how a strobe can make dripping water look like it’s moving upwards. So if I adjust the frames per second…
Coulson: It’s being sent from Earth.
Fitz: Yeah. So once we saw that, we knew what it was.
Simmons: Noah said the wavelength was unusual. He was right, but it’s also familiar. This is the beacon Hive used, sir, to call the Kree to Earth.
Coulson: And now someone’s using it again.
Mack: I know what’s got you worried.
Elena: No, it’s just…
Mack: “How will I ever find job satisfaction without crushing rocks for no good reason?” Am I right?
Elena: It’s like you can read my mind.
Mack: Hey. A lot of stuff happened. I mean, Kasius was toying with us. And we don’t know what we saw back there.
Elena: I do. She said things, upsetting things.
Mack: Kasius was using her to mess with you. Or he was using her to mess with me. I mean, we can’t let it rattle us.
Elena: And what if I can’t let it go?
Mack: Well, look at it like this. We’re gonna change the future anyway.
Elena: I hope we do.
Mack: He was crazy, but we can’t let him in our heads. We need our heads in the game. Both of us, right?
Elena: Yeah. Okay. Who knows what’s true and what’s not, right?
Mack: That’s right. Now, do I need to find a giant rock so you can crush it? Hmm?
Elena: Baby, I don’t need a rock to crush it.
Mack: Mm. No, you do not.
Daisy: Rick Stoner, you mad genius.
Noah: What was that noise?
Daisy: It’s the alert that I set up at this… This is impossible. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Noah: This man is unfamiliar to me.
Daisy: I know him, but from where we all just were. He… He can’t be here. I mean, oh, my God, he cannot be around the cops.
Noah: You’re concerned he will alert the authorities to your presence?
Daisy: We’re the only people that he… he knows in this time. He could tell them that. You have to go get him out of lockup. I obviously can’t go.
Noah: I cannot. That would be interfering with the natural course of…
Daisy: You people literally kidnapped us and then took us to another time.
Noah: As has been thoroughly explained, that was an extinction-level event. Also, it was Enoch. Enoch is very reckless. But you know this, you’ve met him.
Daisy: Fine. I’ll go. But first, I’m gonna need your clothes.
May: Still not a soul.
Fitz: Facing no opposition is usually a good thing, but this?
Mack: Yeah, it’s giving me the creeps.
Simmons: It’s a firewall, an actual firewall. It’s a safety protocol.
May: Fitz, signs of life?
Fitz: Wait. Hang on. There’s someone in there, and they’re alone.
Piper: Not another step or I’ll…
Coulson: Piper?
Piper: Hey, guys. I don’t know how the exact people I needed to show up just showed up, but, thank you, universe.
Coulson: Feeling’s mutual, trust me.
May: What are you doing here?
Piper: Same thing as you, probably. That thing’s about to fire up again. I don’t know how to stop it.
Deke: You’re saying that it’s impossible to imagine anything that you can’t imagine. Like, I couldn’t imagine food that was shaped like animals. Like, that was a totally caught me by surprise. That… Look, I get that you’re not believing my story, sure, but I… I’ve got friends. I’ve got friends in really high government places. We just need to get to them, and then they can smooth this all out.
Daisy: Hi, there.
Wellins: Yes?
Daisy: Um, Chief Wellins, is it? I’m here for Deke Shaw over there. I’m his state-assigned social worker.
Wellins: Well, he didn’t mention a social worker was supervising him. Your name?
Daisy: Sinara. Sinara Smith. It’s Portuguese, Sinara, not Smith. Uh, he wandered off during a day trip. My apologies.
Wellins: He was out of control.
Daisy: Yeah. Says you. He’s not even my toughest customer, believe me. Just a little slippery. If you check online, you’ll see that I sent out an alert when I lost him.
Wellins: What are Mr. Shaw’s issues?
Daisy: I mean, how much time do you have, sir? Uh, complex neurological deficiencies, low… low I.Q., poor motor skills. Oh, he hasn’t, uh, soiled himself today, has he?
Wellins: No, but he was quite inebriated. He told us he was saving the world.
Daisy: Mm. Imagine that.
Wellins: Not the first guy we picked up who’s made big claims. Seems like you’ve got your work cut out for you with this one.
Daisy: Chief, you have no idea.
Hale: You look like you’re ready to suit up for battle.
Lee: We just got a call, ma'am. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been spotted. Orders?
Hale: Keep them there.
Piper: I can’t tell you how relieved I am to see you all in one piece.
Coulson: So, what happened? How did you end up here?
May: Yeah, last we saw you, you HALO’d out of the Zephyr.
Piper: With instructions, if the fight didn’t go your way, I tell your story. Make sure AIDA and The Russian didn’t get away with it.
Coulson: Ivanov.
Piper: Yeah, but I never heard which way it went. No news, no confirmation if…
Coulson: If we were dead?
Piper: Yeah, that. So, I looked for you everywhere, safe houses, any S.H.I.E.L.D. contacts I could find. I even had eyes on your families.
May: Oh, great. One more thing for my mother to be paranoid about.
Piper: I was stealth. Hey, let’s not forget I’m most wanted, too, you know. So, where on Earth were you hiding?
Mack: Well, technically, it was Earth.
Coulson: Story for another time. Go on.
Piper: I had my eye on every news outlet, anything that looked like you guys getting into trouble or out of it. Saw a report about a light coming from the sky.
Mack: You recognized the beacon? Mm. Even took Fitz-Simmons a few hours.
Piper: Yeah, well, let’s not forget, that was my first mission to Union City with you all. Called up from the minors. It was a big day for me. Plus, aliens. You know, they leave an impression.
Elena: You have no idea.
May: So, you came here to warn the staff.
Piper: Yeah, and to kick the blue ass of anything that showed up. I was trained well. They have the beacon here on government contract. Just examining it, and it turned on. Totally random.
Coulson: Did they try to shut it down?
Piper: No. They couldn’t. And I don’t do science, so I sent everyone away.
Mack: Well, Fitz-Simmons will figure it out, eventually.
Piper: Yeah, question is, how long is “eventually?”
Coulson: Yeah. Could be too late.
Daisy: So, yeah, if you check River’s End P.D. online account, you’ll see that I went ahead and took care of Mr. Shaw’s bail. What did we discuss about wandering off without permission? Don’t…
Deke: “Don’t wander off without permission.”
Daisy: Exactly. We went over this. Uh, I also went ahead and made a small contribution to the department’s charity fund to thank you for your trouble.
Wellins: Truth is, I have no desire to keep drunks here in the office. You should go, but take better care of your charges, Ms. Smith.
Daisy: Yes, Chief. Thank you. Of course.
Officer: Hold on!
Daisy: Yeah?
Officer: There’s still paperwork you need to fill out.
Daisy: Yeah. Of course. Whatever you need.
Daisy: Dude.
Deke: I know. There’s just so much paperwork, right? Oh. You probably meant how did I get here. Well, I don’t know. I was with the Monolith and there was a shard and I turned the machine on and then the rock turned all liquid. And then it was, like, buzzing, dizzy, and pushing and pulling, but then bang, Zima.
Daisy: How do you show up in another time and, like, immediately get arrested?
Deke: Have you even tried Zima?
Daisy: I thought they might have gotten you to talk about us or something.
Deke: What? No. I know you guys are covertness. I’m not gonna talk about you. You forget, I survived the Kree.
Daisy: Yeah, by ratting people out.
Deke: Yes, true, that did happen. But not this time.
Daisy: I thought you’d be, like, emotionally distraught or something.
Deke: Emotionally distraught? This is awesome! I thought that I was gonna die. But instead, I’m about to go for a walk outside. Also, there is an outside. I was walking here, and, yes, I was pretty drunk, but I… I saw in a store window there was these green apples and steaks and these… and these things called gummy bears. You know what people aren’t eating here is sterilization pellets. I love this place so much.
Daisy: Okay, yeah, but it’s not all fun and games, okay? Great. So just this, and then we’re free to go?
Officer: That, and I’ll need a number where I can reach you so we can follow up.
Daisy: No problem.
Fitz: I think I’ve got it.
Piper: Makes me look like an idiot.
Coulson: You’ve taken on a lot alone.
Piper: Yeah, well, you guys don’t look like you’ve been on vacation. When do I get the download?
Fitz: The power source was being set off by this. It’s a bimetallic thermal expansion trigger. Well, that… basically, it’s a timer.
Simmons: It looks manmade.
Fitz: Yeah, it is. Everything else in here is new to me. This was installed by hand. A little sloppily, if you ask me.
Piper: I told you, I don’t do science. Relax. No one needs to get hurt.
Elena: What is this?
Piper: I’m sorry. I’m most wanted, too.
Coulson: You cut a deal?
Simmons: You’re saying the beacon…
Piper: The beacon wasn’t meant to call aliens. It was meant to call you.
Man: Drop your weapons.
Piper: The guns are just so nobody does anything stupid.
Fitz: Too late for that.
Coulson: Piper, why?
Piper: I followed your orders. Truthfully, I thought you were dead. When they nabbed me, I told your story.
Coulson: To General Hale.
Piper: Everything. Ivanov, Radcliffe, LMDs, Framework. Look, Hale knows you’re not guilty. She guaranteed your safety. She just… She wanted to bring you in. Okay? You don’t have to run anymore.
Man: Your orders?
Ruby: Kill them.
May: Aaah!
Coulson: Guaranteed our safety?
Piper: What? No, I-It’s do not engage. It’s capture, not kill.
Simmons: Looks a lot like kill.
Mack: They’re not human! Go for the face!
Coulson: You were trained better than this.
Piper: No, Hale is an ally. Talbot’s in a coma. She’s general in command. I thought… No, she’s U.S. military. Look. I just wanted to help.
Coulson: And you got played. We have to take this thing and get out of here before we’re all killed. Are you gonna help? Piper, pick a side, but we’re going.
Piper: I’ll cover you.
Elena: Mack!
Mack: Yo-Yo! Yo-Yo!
Coulson: Go! Go!
Mack: Hold on. We’re gonna get you to the hospital.
Elena: It’s too risky. Confia Jemma.
Simmons: We’re right here.
Piper: I’m so sorry.
Elena: It’s all coming true.
Deke: Okay. Fancy stuff. Here we go.
Daisy: You don’t know what any of this is, do you?
Deke: I know computers. These are computers, right?
Noah: Hello. I’m Noah. I believe saving you from imprisonment was wrong.
Deke: Oh. All right, cool. Well, you seem fun.
May: Daisy. Daisy, come in. We need to land, somewhere close, and fast.
Daisy: May, yeah, I’ve got a surprise for you. Rick Stoner put in a…
May: Send me the coordinates now!
Daisy: May? Are you guys okay?
May: Hurry, Daisy. Please.
Hale: You’re late. Perhaps you’d like to explain what the hell happened out there.
Ruby: I forced their hand.
Hale: Is this some sort of joke to you?
Ruby: They’re gonna have to seek medical attention now. Maybe that’s gonna get them right where we want them.
Hale: No, we had them right where we wanted them.
Ruby: We didn’t have Daisy Johnson. You promised me Daisy Johnson.
Hale: She didn’t show up tonight.
Ruby: Well, I think if I keep cutting her friends’ arms off, she will.
Hale: Your work is sloppy and incomplete, and you’ve been trained to do better, which is why you don’t skip class.
Ruby: Does it matter? They took the beacon.
Hale: The beacon was a backup, a prop. You’re my daughter. And a disappointment. At least the beacon will do what it’s supposed to do.
Daisy: Fitz. I just wanted to make sure that…
Fitz: Yeah, we scanned for signals before we landed. We’re not being tracked.
Daisy: Okay, good.
Fitz: We’re just waiting for the internal circuitry to cool down. It takes a lot to power this thing.
Noah: But it is not cooling down.
Fitz: How is sh… How is she?
Daisy: Still no word. Jemma’s in with her now.
Noah: In fact, it is heating up. Run.
Daisy: What?
Noah: Run. Go! Go! Now!
Hale: Mr. Creel.
Creel: Figured I’d see you again soon.
Hale: Yes, well, I told you I’d find you once S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up again.
Creel: I told you, I’m not interested in being the government’s hired gun. I’m done with that. Didn’t do Talbot any good.
Hale: Yes, well, I’m not interested in a hired gun. I’m putting together a team.
