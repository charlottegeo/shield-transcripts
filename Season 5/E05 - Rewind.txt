Simmons: You’re not eating.
Fitz: Yeah, no. Not really hungry.
Coulson: You know, I think this is the first time we’ve all been together in a really long time.
Woman: Anybody have room for some pie? Okay, so we have apple, strawberry, rhubarb, and chocolate banana cream.
May: Here we go.
Enoch: Phillip J. Coulson.
Coulson: Yep, that’s me. You got us. Nice work. And congrats on the whole power-outage thing. That was very ominous.
Fitz: This is my fault. I’m gonna take full responsibility. Jemma?
Man: Hands in the air! Don’t move!
Evans: Where are the other six?
Lucas: Where are they? Where’d they go?!
Fitz: I don’t know.
Evans: Take him.
Fitz: Wait. No. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, let go. Wait! Just wait! I didn’t do anything! Something happened here! It wasn’t me! I need to find them!
Evans: Footage from the damaged security camera confirms you all walked in together at 8:54 p.m.
Lucas: But at 9:47, when we arrived, you were the only one there. How’d they get out? Where’d they go?
Fitz: I don’t know. Okay. So, you’re saying it wasn’t on the security camera?
Lucas: They conveniently blacked out just over two minutes before we arrived.
Evans: What happened during those two minutes?
Fitz: I swear I’m telling you the truth, I don’t know.
Lucas: Do you like Bendeery English Ale?
Fitz: What?
Lucas: Security cameras captured a Bendeery truck parked just in front of the diner before we arrived. Then it just disappeared, like your friends.
Evans: We’ve… We’ve read your dossier, Fitz. It’s impressive.
Lucas: The Big Bad Brain of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Evans: Did you help them escape with some kind of new S.H.I.E.L.D. technology? How did you know we were coming?
Fitz: I didn’t! There was no crystal ball or… or, “Beam me up, Scotty.” I don’t know how they got away. I have a theory. You did it. You drugged our food or, uh, used some kind of gas, and now you have them in rooms just like this one, and you’re messing with their mind like you’re messing with mine. So why don’t you tell me where the hell are they? Oh, come on. Who the hell is in charge here?!
Hale: Well, it’s not General Talbot, since Agent Johnson put a bullet in his head.
Fitz: That wasn’t her. That was… That was an LMD.
Hale: Oh, right. Alibis by Asimov, huh? Blame it on the robot.
Fitz: No, that’s true.
Hale: If it is, it was built and programmed by S.H.I.E.L.D.
Fitz: It was built by an android called AIDA, and it answered to her, it.
Hale: Is that the one that killed Dr. Holden Radcliffe?
Fitz: Yes.
Hale: And Jeffrey Mace?
Fitz: No, I’m responsible for that death. Okay? I’m telling you the truth, I’m responsible.
Hale: Is that why they left you behind? For you to take the blame, huh?
Fitz: No, they wouldn’t leave me. They wouldn’t… I’m done.
Hale: You’re done when I say you’re done. And if you don’t cooperate, you’re gonna be here for a very long time. Do you understand?
Fitz: Aah.
Man: Time to get up. On your feet! Get up.
Lucas: Where is Phil Coulson?
Fitz: I don’t know.
Lucas: Where is Daisy Johnson?
Fitz: I don’t know.
Lucas: Where is Jemma Simmons?
Fitz: I wish I knew. I wish I knew, ‘cause as much as you want to find them and bring them to justice, I want to find them so I know that they’re okay. I am more than happy to pay for my sins, but I honestly do not know where they are or what happened to them. I swear I will do anything I can to help you find them. If you let me.
Evans: He’s telling the truth.
Hale: Or he beat the machine.
Lucas: I don’t think so. I want him to fry as much as anyone, but he’s the smartest guy we’ve ever had in here. Maybe we should let his brain work for us, help us solve this thing.
Hale: What does he need?
Evans: Papers, pens, books.
Lucas: And a TV. To watch soccer.
Hale: Make sure that’s all he watches.
Fitz: What are you doing?!
Evans: So, what do you have for us this morning?
Fitz: I told you about my experience in the Framework.
Evans: Yes. It seems very traumatic.
Fitz: And I did suffer previous brain trauma, which may have been exacerbated. I may have suffered from Prodromal Schizophrenia. So it’s possible I did something to them, or, uh, I helped them escape, or something worse and blocked the memory.
Evans: We interviewed everyone there, Fitz. They all had the same two-minute lapse in memory. It wasn’t you.
Fitz: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
Evans: Are you okay?
Fitz: Yeah. There was something else, actually. There was, um, a high-pitched, uh… Books. I’m gonna need more books. Books on, uh, sonic frequencies, sound waves.
Evans: Get us a list. We’ll get them.
Fitz: And there’s something else. Would you be able to post this? Worst keeper I’ve ever seen in my life.
Evans: It’s a letter to a soccer fanzine. The least offensive part is when he calls the goalkeeper a Cro-Magnon Twit.
Lucas: Redact his name. Have it analyzed by our code-breakers. It’ll keep him happy. His intel on Radcliffe’s base panned out, so he’s helping us. And he’s our only chance at finding the others.
Fitz: What are you doing? What are you doing?! It’s a free kick!
Evans: In six months, you haven’t brought us a single plausible theory.
Fitz: I know. I know. And I’ve been racking my brains, but I think…
Lucas: No more thinking. You’re out of time. We want an answer.
Fitz: Okay. I have one. I know what happened.
Lucas: By all means. Enlighten us.
Fitz: They were abducted by aliens.
Hale: All right, that’s it. We’re done with you. No more books, no more television. You’ve wasted our time. You’re gonna grow old and die alone in that cell. What? Here? How?
Man: Hey, you can’t go in there without authorization.
Hale: Your attorney is here.
Hunter: Get those cuffs off my client and get the hell out of here.
Fitz: They printed my letters in the last six issues of Ballbuster Hooligans.
Hunter: And how many copies do you think are available in Bangladesh? None. As in zero. Soon as I heard you were missing, I got hold of some. Where do you get off on calling Liverpool a bunch of wankers?
Fitz: Well, if you never win anything, then how do…
Hunter: Well, at least we’re not trying to buy our way back to glory.
Fitz: Hey. Do not talk crap about Man U.
Hunter: Me talking crap? Your letters were nothing but crap. All that stuff about the… How many European Cups have you won?
Fitz: Well, got your attention, didn’t it? Finally. After six months!
Hunter: Well, maybe I should’ve just thrown them out and left you here.
Fitz: I missed you.
Hunter: You, too, mate.
Fitz: It’s good to see you. Mm-hmm.
Hunter: Okay. Okay. There… There’ll be times for more hugs later. Okay. Okay.
Fitz: Hey, uh, where are we?
Hunter: You’re in a secure military installation. One of those “doesn’t exist” places. But the law’s the law, so they had to let me in.
Fitz: Okay. Well, at least you gave me enough time to come up with a good escape plan. So, it’s a mechanism that, um, I can slowly assemble, but I’m gonna need you to smuggle it in piece by piece. Um, so, if… if you could visit three times a week for a month, then, uh, then I should have everything I need. What are you doing?
Hunter: I’m gonna need you to move two meters to your left. Mm-hmm. And come forward. There we go.
Fitz: What the bloody hell?!
Hunter: Your coded message didn’t have an escape plan, so I had to come up with one of my own. Come on. Let’s go. There’s our way out!
Fitz: Who’s flying it?
Hunter: Rusty. The best getaway pilot money can buy. Well, the best getaway pilot my money could buy.
Fitz: Please tell me your escape plan involves an actual escape.
Hunter: He was supposed to draw their attention, lead them on a wild goose chase up in the air, while we were getting away on the ground.
Fitz: Well, he’s definitely got their attention.
Hunter: Come on.
Fitz: Wait. That piece of junk is our ride?
Hunter: Yeah, it’s Rusty’s, God bless his cold, black soul. And it’s the last thing they’ll be looking for. The last thing they’ll be thinking is that two ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents would be stupid enough to try and escape in this whale.
Fitz: Apparently, we are.
Hunter: There you go. Your phone. You’re welcome. Now, Rusty kitted this thing out with all sorts of bells and whistles.
Fitz: Is one of those bells an engine?
Hunter: There we go. See? It’s even got cloaking.
Hale: How the hell did he contact an attorney without any outside communication?
Evans: He mailed some letters.
Lucas: We mailed them. Rants to a magazine. I had them analyzed and cleared. There was nothing there.
Hale: Well, obviously, there was. Analyze them again. If you crack the code, you find out who he’s talking to.
Man: We checked all the surveillance footage within a two-mile radius. Everything checks out except this.
Hale: Are they the idiots, or are we?
Evans: They won’t get far in that thing.
Hale: Well, if you find them, don’t engage. They could lead us to the others.
Hunter: Just his head set on fire? Nothing else?
Fitz: Um, no.
Hunter: That’s the strangest thing I’ve ever heard. Except for the sexy robot that you made that became human and wanted you to stick the old floppy into her love drive.
Fitz: Can we not talk about this, please?
Hunter: Copy that. Message received. Well, my life has been perfectly boring by comparison. Mercenary work, working with unscrupulous dirtbags like Rusty.
Fitz: How are things with Bobbi?
Hunter: Good. Yeah. We’re 100% compatible, 50% of the time. Nearly got married again. Until the ninjas showed up.
Fitz: So you are together?
Hunter: Together forever, just doing our own thing. Distance is our savior. How about you and Simmons? Did you find a way to work it out?
Fitz: Distance is our curse.
Hunter: So, how are we gonna find her?
Fitz: Okay. Um, the only real clue we have is a Bendeery English Ale truck.
Hunter: Chasing a beer truck. I like this plan. Do we get to plunder it when we find it?
Fitz: No, it vanished. I need a way to find it.
Hunter: Then you, my friend, are in the right RV. Among Rusty’s more useful traits, piloting being henceforth removed from that list, is that he was paranoid as balls. A die-hard conspiracy theorist who liked to spy on anyone he thought was spying on him, which was everyone.
Fitz: So, he can tap into surveillance.
Hunter: Yep.
Fitz: Where is it?
Hunter: At the back, beyond the margarita machine and the ferret cages.
Fitz: Oh, that’s plenty of bells and whistles. Thank you, Rusty.
Fitz: There it is. So, the truck arrived at the diner just before they vanished. Look. That’s them. There’s ten of them. Who’s that? All the surveillance cameras within a two-mile radius went dark for those two minutes. How is that possible? Where are you going?
Hunter: There it is.
Fitz: No, that’s a postal truck.
Hunter: There?
Fitz: No.
Hunter: Why can you never find a beer truck when you need one?
Fitz: Unless…
Hunter: Ruddy bloody hell.
Fitz: Got you now.
Enoch: I’ve been expecting you.
Hunter: What? Wait. No. We’re here to surprise you, so act surprised.
Enoch: There’s no need for violence.
Fitz: You were at the diner. I saw you. Y-You put them in your truck, and you brought them here. Where are they?
Enoch: Two Zero Nine One. Earth Year. Two Zero Nine One.
Hunter: Why do I get the feeling there’s a kill room in the basement?
Fitz: Where is this? What’s happening? No. Who the hell are you?
Enoch: I was sent here 30,000 years ago to observe and record the evolution of your species. What you would call an anthropologist. My Earth name is Enoch. I am a sentient Chronicom from a planet which revolves around a star in the constellation you know as Cygnus.
Hunter: Yeah. We’ll just go with “Enoch.”
Fitz: Why? Why did you send them through that thing?
Enoch: To fulfill a prophesy. This speaks of the future. They were needed there.
Hunter: Look, there’s only so much crazy talk I can take before I start shooting holes in it.
Fitz: Why didn’t you take me?
Enoch: You weren’t part of the Seer’s prophecy, Mr. Fitz.
Hunter: You don’t seriously believe all this, do you? A prophecy and a Monolith that sends you through time?
Fitz: Send me through to them.
Enoch: The Stone can only be activated from the other end. I only knew when it would open. I have no knowledge of who opened it.
Fitz: Somebody does. The, uh… The Seer? Let’s start there. Take me.
Enoch: I don’t think it’s wise.
Fitz: You don’t think… You are going to take me to whoever or whatever this Seer is, or your future ends now.
Enoch: I am trying to help, Mr. Fitz. You did not need to threaten me.
Fitz: Sorry. I’m just worried about my friends.
Hunter: So, who is it?
Enoch: There.
Lucas: Search every room. They were here. I want to know why. What the hell?
Evans: Stay on the RV, but keep your distance and do not engage. We want to know where they’re going.
Lucas: What do you make of all this?
Evans: I have no idea.
Polly: Hi, Enoch.
Enoch: Hello, Polly.
Fitz: I know you. You’re Polly Hinton.
Polly: Do I know you?
Fitz: I’m with S.H.I.E.L.D. Can I…?
Fitz: You must be Robin. I’m Fitz. I’m friends with Daisy.
Lucas: What are we dealing with here?
Evans: Is there a kid’s room in this house?
Lucas: No. Single male, lives alone.
Evans: That magic crystal ball we were theorizing about? It’s real, but it’s not S.H.I.E.L.D. tech. It’s a child.
Hunter: So, she’s the Seer? You are a very good artist. Can I have a look? This is prophecy?
Polly: She’s been very active lately.
Fitz: What is that? What are these… What are these symbols?
Enoch: An ancient language from another galaxy. Never known to anyone on Earth. Until her.
Hunter: The quiet type, eh? Wish you could teach Bobbi that. Get a drink in her, and she’s like a wind-up doll. You can’t…
Robin: They’re here for us.
Fitz: Let’s go. Come on.
Enoch: Put these in.
Evans: You’re coming with us. The girl, too, so don’t even think about trying to run… away.
Lucas: We just lost a half an hour of time.
Fitz: I think we lost them.
Hunter: Not for long. We need to find a place to lay low for a while.
Enoch: I’m taking you to the place where I sent the others.
Fitz: You said that was impossible.
Enoch: I’m taking you where, not when.
Hunter: Under a lighthouse, eh? How far down does this go?
Enoch: Unknown.
Fitz: What is it?
Enoch: Unknown.
Fitz: Who built it?
Enoch: Unknown.
Evans: They just disappeared. It had to be the same blackout technology they used at the diner.
Hale: Do we have any idea who the girl is?
Lucas: We’ve got images from surveillance cameras across the street. We’re running facial-recognition scans on her and her mother.
Hale: Well, make it your highest priority. If she’s able to predict and forewarn, she might be able to tell secrets. I want you to find her and control her. It’s better she’s on our side. We need every weapon in this fight.
Enoch: As of this moment, you are the only four humans who know of this place’s existence.
Fitz: How do you know about it?
Enoch: We’ll stay until we can decide what to do with her. She is no longer safe.
Hunter: Why don’t you just ask her? She seems to know everything else.
Enoch: She gives answers in her own time. It’s better not to interfere.
Fitz: Hey. You sent my friends into the future. I’d call that some serious interference.
Enoch: Our protocol allows for one exception, the prevention of an extinction-level event.
Fitz: What?
Hunter: So what happened?
Enoch: Unknown.
Hunter: Sad, isn’t it? To know all she knows and not be able to do a thing about it.
Fitz: Maybe she’s trying.
Hunter: No. You can’t save the world. I can barely save myself. What’s her story? How do you know her?
Fitz: Her father was an Inhuman. Every time he touched someone, he and that person would have a vision of an impending death. And it must have been torturous. So he couldn’t have any human contact. Not with his wife. Not with his… not his baby daughter.
Hunter: And they still call these “gifts?”
Fitz: He saved Daisy. And she was convinced that she could save him, change the future, but…
Hunter: What’s written is written.
Fitz: Jemma and I were there. Holding hands. We had no idea.
Hunter: So, you and Simmons?
Fitz: Yeah. Yeah, we’re together now. Everyone knows. Even looked for a place together.
Hunter: Oh, congrats, mate. I remember when you couldn’t even admit that you liked her.
Fitz: Maybe it should have stayed that way. Everything that keeps happening to us does seem like the universe doesn’t want us to be together.
Hunter: The universe doesn’t want or care about anything. And even if it did, why wouldn’t it want you to be together? You two are so perfect for each other, it makes everyone a little bit nauseous.
Fitz: Maybe it’s trying to protect her.
Hunter: From what?
Fitz: From me. From what I was in the Framework, ‘cause that came from inside me. That’s… wasn’t programming.
Hunter: Was that the Fitz I saw back at Enoch’s place?
Fitz: Yeah.
Hunter: I have to admit, I kind of liked seeing that side of you. And it worked for us. Got Enoch on the right page.
Fitz: Yeah, well, it also got people killed.
Hunter: Look, I don’t know what you went through, but I know you’re not a cold-blooded killer. Every light needs a shadow. You just have to learn how to control it, use it when you need it.
Fitz: I can’t stand it being anywhere inside of me. I think that’s why they left me behind, I think 'cause I’m too much of a risk to them to… too much of a risk to Jemma.
Hunter: Bollocks. You want to know why you were left behind? Ask the one that kicked you off the guest list.
Fitz: Get it while it’s hot.
Polly: Thanks. It smells good. I’m sorry about your friends.
Fitz: Did Robin ever say why I wasn’t supposed to go with them?
Polly: She doesn’t say much at all. Not since Terrigenesis. I found her in a state just like her father.
Fitz: She was way too young to go through that.
Polly: Her mind has been scattered. Past, present, future, it’s all the same to her, all mixed up. Sometimes, she doesn’t even know I’m her mother.
Fitz: I’m sorry.
Polly: Enoch has been very helpful. He’s helped me to understand and accept. And she lives mostly inside her head now, but we can try. Robin, sweetie. Mr. Fitz has brought you some breakfast. And he has a question for you. He’d like to know why he’s not with his friends. Can you tell Fitz? He’d really like to know why he’s not with them.
Robin: 'Cause you have to save them.
Fitz: They’re in trouble some 70 years in the future, and there’s nothing I can do? I’ll be a skeleton by the time they get here.
Enoch: I may know another way.
Hunter: Oh, now there’s a way? What happened to no interference?
Enoch: It’s prophecy now.
Hunter: Right.
Fitz: How, Enoch? How do I get to them?
Enoch: I came to Earth in a small capsule. It was discovered decades ago and is now secured in a warehouse. It might be able to take you to them.
Fitz: Okay. Where is it?
Enoch: Have you heard of a place called Blue Raven Ridge?
Hunter: You’re joking.
Fitz: You know it?
Hunter: Yeah, of course I know it. We just broke out of it. It’s the military base they were holding you in.
Fitz: Okay, well, hate to say it, but we’re gonna have to break back in.
Hunter: We’re breaking a basic rule of espionage. Never walk into the same place as two different people.
Fitz: We don’t have a choice. You sure these I.D.s are gonna hold up?
Hunter: I hope so. Cooter didn’t have much time.
Fitz: Cooter?
Hunter: An old friend of Rusty’s. He’s very…
Fitz: Let me guess, he’s the best your money could afford.
Hunter: Afternoon. We’re here to fix a hole in the wall.
Man: I.D.s. Rusty Peltzer and Jimmy Futterman.
Hunter: That’s us. You break it, we fix it and charge you the military mark-up. Too much? If Cooter hasn’t got us in the system, then this is all over.
Fitz: No. Then we’ll find another way.
Hunter: What? From our tiny little cells?
Man: All clear. You know where you’re going?
Hunter: Know it like the back of our hands.
Hunter: Rusty always said there was alien artifacts on this base. Maybe he wasn’t so crazy after all.
Fitz: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful. These are extremely volatile and unpredictable. Screw up once, you could lose a limb.
Hunter: Once we do this, that’s it, no turning back.
Fitz: Let’s do it.
Hunter: Okay. Release the ferrets.
Man 1: What’s that mean?
Man 2: Something’s setting off the perimeter alarms. You seeing this?
Man: We got a 10-98 here. Repeat, a 10-98.
Fitz: They’ll instinctively head for the drains and vents. Motion sensors will interpret that as an escape, right? And procedure will seal the perimeter, leaving us alone in here.
Hunter: Which is fine till we need to get out.
Fitz: This is it.
Hunter: You sure this is it?
Fitz: This is gonna get me there if I’m lucky. All right. Let’s get this back on the truck.
Hunter: We’re not gonna need a truck.
Hunter: Brings back memories. We had some good times back in the day, in between all the bad times and being shot at and chased and attacked by monsters.
Fitz: Yeah. This place, the base, always felt like home. Like family.
Hunter: Ah, don’t worry. You’ll be together again soon.
Fitz: You’re just saying that.
Hunter: Yeah, of course I am. They’re stuck 70-odd years in the future, and our world’s about to end. The odds, my friend, are not in your favor.
Fitz: Are they ever?
Hunter: Well, let’s see what we’ve got here. Fitzy. We just hit the jackpot.
Fitz: They’ve brought everything from S.H.I.E.L.D.
Man: What the hell’s going on here?!
Fitz: Go upstairs, fire up the guidance system, and activate auto-takeoff. I’ll hold them off here and close the doors!
Hunter: Uh, shouldn’t you do the technical, and I’ll…
Fitz: Go!
Hunter: All right.
Hale: I know you mean well. I’m sorry that it has to end this way, but you have continually let me down. I don’t trust you anymore.
Evans: You’re demoting us?
Hale: No. I need a cleaning crew.
Fitz: These will be waiting for me when I get there. Team S.H.I.E.L.D. will be fully armed.
Polly: How does this get Fitz to the future?
Fitz: It’s a Cryo-Freeze Chamber.
Hunter: What?!
Fitz: Yeah. I’m taking the long way there. Gonna sleep for 74 years.
Hunter: That is the most insane idea in our history of insane ideas.
Fitz: Yep.
Hunter: We can’t hide you in a wall. You’ll suffocate when you wake up. And if we leave you sitting around here, who knows what people or things are gonna find their way in there.
Enoch: He’s not going to be here. I summoned a Chronicom Vessel. We’ll orbit a planet hidden safely away from Earth until he wakes up.
Hunter: Oh, great. That’s brilliant.
Enoch: Are you ready?
Hunter: We’ll look after those two. Bobbi could use a good cause.
Enoch: Thank you, Lance Hunter.
Hunter: Just make sure he gets back okay.
Fitz: Well, I guess this is it.
Hunter: I’ve had a hell of a time, as always. I guess I underestimated your odds. Don’t die out there, mate.
Fitz: All right. Yep. Okay. Yep.
Hunter: I love you.
Fitz: I know.
Enoch: Good morning, Fitz. Rise and shine. While you were asleep, I had time to put a plan in motion. We have a few days until we arrive at the Lighthouse. That should give me enough time to prepare you.
Fitz: Prepare me for what?
Enoch: For facing off against some of the most ruthless and brutal mobsters, monsters, and mercenaries in the galaxy. I hope you have it in you.
Fitz: I have it in me.
