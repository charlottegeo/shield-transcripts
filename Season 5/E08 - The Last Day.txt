Simmons: Three more cities just went dark. It’s spreading too fast.
May: The Lighthouse is still 200 miles out!
Agent: Hey! You’re not supposed to be here. Where the hell is this girl’s mother?
Simmons: Polly didn’t make it this far.
May: Robin, go back downstairs with the others. It’s not safe up here.
Robin: It’s okay. We survive the crash.
May: What cra…
Simmons: There’s a gravity storm heading right for us!
May: Sit down! Buckle up!
Robin: There’s something else I need…
Robin: … to remember. Sorry. W-What did you ask?
May: How are you even here?
Robin: I told you we’d survive the crash.
May: The crash? I’m not sure I know what you’re…
Voss: Don’t be put out if you can’t follow Robin’s train of thought. It’s like her life is a deck of cards shuffled out of order. She’s a seer, all right, but nowadays, she can’t separate past, present, and future. Samuel Voss. My apologies for the rough rescue, but you got to act fast when gravity storms start kicking up.
May: You’re going back out?
Voss: Yeah, my crew’s gonna go out and collect your friends.
May: Wait. They made it to the surface? How do you know?
Voss: She told me. A decade ago. Sounds like them now. Don’t worry. Robin told me they survive this crash, too.
Coulson: Love what they’ve done with the place.
May: Looks like, uh, you had a rough landing.
Coulson: Yeah, can’t recommend the airline. Inexperienced pilot, lot of turbulence, ran out of pretzels in coach.
Daisy: May.
May: Daisy.
Daisy: Oh, my God.
May: Daisy.
Daisy: Oh, it’s good to see you. What? It’s crazy the Zephyr ended up on the last remaining chunk of Earth.
May: Yeah. Must’ve been en route to the Lighthouse before it crashed.
Coulson: Wonder if that means some of us survived the end of the world?
Daisy: I doubt I made it.
Coulson: Ooh.
May: Medical, same place.
Daisy: Okay. It’s good to see you.
Coulson: Glad we finally found some allies. You get any answers about who they are, why they brought us here?
May: Just more questions. I have a lot to catch you up on.
Deke: No, you don’t understand. Not just dead. As far as everyone in the Lighthouse was concerned, everybody that came up here was torn to scraps. But they’re all still alive and living in an actual airplane.
Simmons: Fitz, your design really withstood the test of time.
Deke: Woah, you designed this? Damn. Can’t imagine what it must’ve been like to fly.
Fitz: Technically, I’m the engineer, I’m not the pilot.
Deke: Oh. Yeah, well, that’s still cool, I guess.
Voss: Holy hell. Is that Deke Shaw? Ha! I’ll be damned! Thought I was looking at your old man 20 years ago! Welcome.
Deke: Oh, my God, Voss. I should’ve known that even the roaches wouldn’t touch you.
Voss: Ha! Never thought I’d see you tagging along with these folks.
Deke: It’s a long story.
Voss: Well, let’s hear all about it, huh? You can tell me whether these guys are the real deal or not. I’m surprised you’re the only one of ours to make the trip. And Virgil?
Deke: The Roaches got him. I’m sorry. I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. I feel like he could’ve told me that he was exchanging messages with my dead dad.
Voss: We didn’t know who to trust.
Deke: Clearly. So, where is he?
Voss: Your dad was transmitting from a radio tower a few days out. He’s on his way back now, but he is gonna be so happy to see you.
Deke: Is he?
Voss: Oh, come on.
Deke: Just, the way we left things, it wasn’t really…
Voss: No, no, no, no, listen. He never held any of that against you, all right? If anything is to blame, it’s the Lighthouse. That place did a number on all of us.
Kasius: Are there any signs of life on the downed trawler? There must be some indication. If they fled to the surface, they may have the means to survive there. The Destroyer of Worlds has proven quite resourceful. You want to go after her? If she’s alive, reclaim our property. If not, at least we’ll have a trophy. All resources are at your disposal. While you’re away, I’ll focus on the human traitors who aided the escape. We’ve been far too lenient with those who serve us. Hmm. It’s clear they require a firmer hand. Their disobedience must be punished.
Sinara: A renewal?
Kasius: No. Retribution. This ends today.
Elena: Well, it’s not that someone forgot to pay the electric bill.
Flint: The Kreepers are playing games again.
Mack: It feels more like an endgame. We need to move quickly, get to level 3, where Fitz hid those weapons.
Elena: Had to leave them on the level with the giant space bugs, huh? Have you seen those things?
Flint: Nope. Still don’t want to. The service tunnel’s up ahead. It’s our way up.
Gretchen: Hey, Flint. This is your fault, so you know!
Elena: Hey, he didn’t ask for any of this.
Gretchen: They already cut the water. Now the lights? They’re punishing us for what you did.
Man: You should be down with the other Inhumans, where you belong!
Gretchen: Turn yourself in!
Man: You can’t be here!
Mack: Hey! You don’t want to go down this road.
Coulson: It all makes sense. Robin is the reason we’re here. She’s the connection between the two points in time. This is our answer.
May: The problem is, for her, those two times are indistinguishable.
Fitz: Well, the decades haven’t made her any easier to understand.
Simmons: It’s like she’s still a little girl. Best not to crowd her.
Fitz: Yeah.
Coulson: Hello, Robin. We’ve had quite a journey to get to you. I was hoping you might tell us why you brought us here. What are we supposed to do?
Robin: I already told my mother.
Coulson: Told her what?
Robin: Everything.
May: She’s been in and out since I got here. I asked her why we were taken from the diner.
Coulson: And?
May: She said it was the last time we were all seen together.
Coulson: That doesn’t bode well.
Robin: Phillip J. Coulson. He can bring all the pieces together.
Coulson: Pieces of what?
Robin: This is the day it all ends.
Daisy: So, the lady who sees the future says that there isn’t one. Super.
Coulson: Unfortunately, Robin’s not much for specifics. Anyone who has the answers is either unreliable, dead, or wants us dead.
May: So, status quo.
Daisy: Yep. The homicidal blue bastards are the most pressing issue. We made a pretty big splash when we broke out of the Lighthouse.
Coulson: Hope Mack and Yo-Yo are holding their own. We’re gonna come to blows with Kasius soon. Only question is, who strikes first? Be nice to have Quake back with us when that happens.
Daisy: Won’t be quaking anything with this thing on.
Coulson: Have Fitz and Simmons take a look. We’ll keep working with Robin, see what else shakes loose.
Daisy: Copy. I thought that I had a lot to process. This must be blowing your mind.
Deke: Yeah, a little. When you’re a kid, you… you learn fast not to cross the Kreepers because they’ll send you to the surface, and up there, you die. But, hey, turns out that everything’s a lie and people can survive up here, and even that batty old lady made it.
Daisy: The one who sees through time? Probably should’ve mentioned that.
Deke: Yeah, well, I thought she was crazy, all right? And as I mentioned, dead. Back in the Lighthouse, Virgil used to bring her tea every day and listen to her stories. That is, until Kasius sent her and my dad topside.
Daisy: Must have been sad to lose him. I’m sorry.
Deke: No, I was too bitter to be sad. As far as I was concerned, his looney theories got my mom killed. So he gets himself sent to the surface, good riddance. Then you guys actually show up.
Daisy: Sucks when your parents get to say, “I told you so.”
Deke: Yeah, he can say it. I just hope he says that he forgives me.
Daisy: Yeah, well, from my experience, he probably wants the same thing.
Deke: Experience?
Daisy: I didn’t meet my dad until I was in my 20s, and all he really wanted to do was make up for lost time.
Deke: How’d that work out?
Daisy: Bit of a rocky start, but we… we got there.
Elena: It’s clear, for now.
Mack: Let’s go. It’s not much further.
Flint: You sure?
Mack: We made it off this floor alive before. We’ll do it again.
Flint: And then what? Back to level 10, where my friends want to kill me? At least the roaches would be quick.
Elena: Some of my friends never saw me the same after I became an Inhuman, but I did nothing wrong and neither did you.
Mack: Hey!
Flint: That’s the stuff the Blues use to keep the Vrellnexians away.
Elena: What is he doing on this floor?
Mack: I have no idea. But I’ll feel a lot safer with a real weapon in my hand.
Simmons: It feels good, being back on the Zephyr.
Fitz: Just wish it were in the right time.
Simmons: Yeah, well, I’d rather be here than in that silent alien slave bunker.
Fitz: Point taken.
Simmons: Can you believe all these things survived the apocalypse? Well, that looks like an isochronus cyclotron, but…
Fitz: But with resonant superconducting coils. That’s strange.
Simmons: What do you think it does?
Voss: It opened the portal that brought you here. Take that top box right there.
Fitz: Who built that, and how does it work?
Simmons: That thing controls the monolith? Are you sure?
Voss: Whoa, whoa. Deke warned me that you scientists would be full of questions.
Fitz: Yes, and we are also partial to answers.
Voss: Owen put it together. Deke’s old man. Tried to explain it to me a dozen times, but I don’t think he can even get his own head around it.
Simmons: What, he didn’t design it?
Voss: No. Built it from some old schematics. That damn thing drew a year’s battery reserves when he fired it up. Didn’t think it did anything, but sure enough, here you are. Heroes from the past. Oh, hey. Suppose I should say welcome home, huh?
Fitz: Maybe Deke’s father will have some more information we can use. But until then, we are on our own.
Simmons: I guess we are.
Coulson: What about Mack and Yo-Yo? Are they in danger? Is Kasius gonna attack? You think Fitz’s new friend could help?
May: Enoch. You spent some time with Robin when she was a little girl. How did you get her to open up?
Enoch: For the most part, she talked only to her mother, although she would occasionally speak to me if I spent several days by her side. Patience is a Chronicom’s greatest tool.
Coulson: And for those of us with a limited life span?
Enoch: I apologize I cannot be of more help. Robin’s gift is powerful, but it cannot be forced. Sometimes all one can do is wait.
Coulson: That’s not always an option. If we can’t get Robin to talk, we have to shift gears. Our people in the Lighthouse need backup.
May: Sure. But Daisy’s still powerless. And I’m not winning any fights with this hole in my leg.
Coulson: I don’t know. You look pretty spry for someone who was born over a hundred years ago. Hey, we always make it through somehow. And if not…
May: I’m not willing to lose anyone.
Coulson: That’s not all on you.
May: Then what is? If I can’t protect the team, what? I’m not a scientist, and I can’t fly a dead aircraft.
Coulson: You’re the one I trust to always have my back… Robin, I’m sorry. We need more than a drawing. We need help.
May: What are you trying to tell us?
May: The population is barely holding on. And the water filtration system?
Fitz: Could go at any minute, just like the solar-power arrays.
Simmons: And if we lose supplemental power, we lose climate control, kicking off a series of cascading failures. We’re hanging by a thread.
May: Then we hang on for as long as we can, try to minimize the damage. But Robin said there’s another way.
Fitz: Oh, not the girl’s bloody time machine again. It’s impossible. You cannot change time. It’s fixed.
May: What if it’s not? She’s been right about everything else, and for us to even have a chance, you and Simmons have to design the machine.
Fitz: Okay. So, we spend decades on the schematics. What happens when we don’t finish the job?
Simmons: Then we trust that someone else will carry on after us.
May: We have to give ourselves the chance.
Robin: This is to remind you.
May: Not today, Robin.
Robin: You gave them everything you could.
Mack: Hello, gorgeous.
Flint: I don’t get it. Doesn’t the axe make it harder to shoot?
Mack: It makes it easier to chop heads off.
Elena: I scouted the whole floor. I didn’t see a single Virlnex… Verel… Verlo… I’m not even trying. The Roaches are gone.
Flint: Wait. Isn’t that a good thing?
Mack: No. ‘Cause it means the Blue Man Group sent them somewhere else.
Flint: Oh, no. The elevator, they released them downstairs.
Coulson: You’re like a post-apocalyptic Eagle Scout.
Voss: Not sure what that means, but I like it.
May: This must have taken you years to salvage.
Voss: I’ve been wanting to take on the Blues my entire life, so if you’re here to help, you just might be the saviors of humanity after all. That is, if you’re up to the challenge.
May: Same goes for you and your team. Coulson.
Coulson: Last time I saw this, it sent us to the future. How’d you get a piece of the monolith?
Voss: We’ve held on to that for a long time. Became something of a symbol for everyone who believed in the prophecy.
Coulson: It’s more than a symbol. If we find more of these, could give us a shot at going back home.
May: Maybe Robin can tell us where the rest are.
Voss: Uh, yeah, I-I don’t want to retch in anyone’s rations, but that’s actually the only piece we’ve ever seen.
Coulson: The others are out there somewhere.
Voss: Sure, but don’t you think that we should focus on something more achievable, like storming the Lighthouse, showing Kasius the outside of an airlock, maybe?
Coulson: Absolutely. But Fitz and Simmons need to see this.
Fitz: That’s not a happy face, Jemma.
Simmons: Well, the inhibitor’s embedded itself in the greater auricular nerve.
Daisy: Okay.
Simmons: Removing it requires sophisticated tools and a trained neurosurgeon, neither of which we have. Even if we did, the slightest error could paralyze you from the neck down.
Daisy: Okay. So we leave it alone, then.
Coulson: We found a literal piece of the puzzle.
Simmons: The monolith, it’s been fractured.
Deke: Where’d you find that?
May: Voss had it in his locker.
Coulson: The survivors who believed in the prophecy held on to it for years.
Fitz: Here.
Daisy: What are we looking at?
Fitz: The shard fits into the machine right here.
Simmons: Maybe that’s how it was able to target the monolith across time. This could be our way home.
Fitz: Yeah, but the shard alone isn’t enough. We need the whole monolith.
Coulson: It’d be great if Robin could help us fill in the blanks here. Daisy, you knew her first. Maybe you can get through to her.
Daisy: I can try.
May: If she helps us get home, maybe none of this ever happens.
Mack: That fog could’ve driven every roach in the bunker down here.
Flint: Hurry!
Gretchen: Aaah! Aaah!
Flint: Hey! Over here, you ugly bastard!
Flint: Shotgun axe. I get it now.
Elena: Are you okay?
Gretchen: The Roaches, they’re everywhere. I don’t know how many.
Elena: We need to take people to safety, then clear the floor, room by room.
Mack: That’ll take too long, even for you. I got another idea. Can you grab something from upstairs, fast?
Elena: You got it, Turtle Man.
Mack: Okay. For this to work, we need access to the air-filtration system.
Flint: I can take you there. But what are we gonna do?
Mack: We’re gonna take back this floor.
Robin: Flint. Flint. Flint.
May: Don’t fall behind. Come on.
Elena: Get out of my way!
May: Yo-Yo, what are you doing?
Elena: Something I should’ve done a long time ago.
May: You can’t. Working with them is our only option. We need their power generators, their water-filtration sys…
Elena: Who cares what they’re offering? It’s not worth our freedom. We both know they want to enslave us.
May: Think about what Robin predicted, what will happen if you fight…
Elena: She also predicted that we would save the world, and look at us now.
May: We need you with us.
Robin: Flint. Flint.
Elena: Who is this “us?” We change our name, we whisper in the shadows. Whatever happened to S.H.I.E.L.D., huh?
May: We’re doing the best we can.
Robin: Flint. Flint would understand.
Elena: There is no Flint! Seriously, she needs to stop talking about people who won’t be born for 50 years.
May: Robin, now is not the time.
Robin: No. No one listens to me. Mack will help Flint…
Elena: Mack is gone! And he’s never coming back.
May: Please, have faith.
Elena: I’m sorry, Melinda, but I stopped believing a long time ago.
Voss: Hey.
Deke: What are they doing with the shard?
Voss: Who, Coulson and May? Hell if I know, but if you ask me, they got their priorities way out of whack.
Deke: No, that’s not what I mean. That belonged to my mom. Why doesn’t my dad have it with him? After my mom died, he always kept it close. He wouldn’t have left it behind.
Voss: Don’t overthink it, kid. It’s pretty dangerous out there in the wastelands. He probably just left it here for safekeeping.
Deke: No. Before the Blues exiled him, I begged him for that stupid rock so I’d have something to remember her by, and he said that he couldn’t trust me with it.
Voss: You need to calm down.
Deke: No, you need to stop lying to me. He wouldn’t leave it in your locker. So what the hell did you do to my father?
Voss: Hyah!
Flint: That box controls the entire floor. But the Blues shut the power off.
Mack: Not a problem. Fitz knows how to pack for any occasion. Come on. Beautiful. And Yo-Yo got us plenty of these.
Flint: You know that gas won’t be enough to kill the Roaches, right?
Mack: Yeah, but it should be enough to drive them into one room.
Flint: Okay. Then what do we do?
Mack: We don’t do anything.
Flint: Whoa.
Mack: Dial it back a notch, Pebbles.
Robin: Thank you, Daisy.
Daisy: Your dad would be glad you still have that. I, um, I promised him that I would protect you. And I’m sorry that I couldn’t do more. Life in the Lighthouse and then up here, it… it couldn’t have been easy.
Robin: My mother always kept me safe. There was something I was supposed to tell her.
Daisy: Could you tell me? You tried to warn Coulson about something. Was it about the piece of the monolith? Robin, do… do you know where we can find the rest?
Robin: Time, it’s… it’s… it’s running out.
Daisy: Running out for what? What are we supposed to do? What should…
Voss: I’ve had my fair share of those conversations. She has important things to say, just doesn’t always say them at the right time.
Daisy: I’m trying to be patient with her, but it’s hard when the last thing she predicted was our imminent doom.
Voss: Let her rest. I might have something that’ll give you the answers you’re looking for.
Simmons: That’s interesting. This bit here, laser vibrometer. So, it… it measures the resonant frequencies of the monolith piece…
Fitz: And locks onto the frequencies in the monolith through space-time. Yes, you were right. I’ll fill in the others. Jemma, did you lock the door?
Simmons: No.
Fitz: Coulson?! Coulson?!
May: What’s going on?
Fitz: Coulson?!
Man: If you don’t put up a fight, you don’t have to die.
Fitz: Coulson, we’re stuck in here.
Voss: Must be strange for you to see the world like this after what happened.
Daisy: Look, I know everyone thinks I’m this Destroyer of Worlds, but I’m not that powerful. I couldn’t break a planet apart even if I wanted to.
Voss: But somehow, it happened.
Daisy: Yeah, well, maybe the history books got it wrong.
Voss: Yeah. I’m sorry to say, but they didn’t. We found this on the hard drive on the Zephyr. That was the last time anyone saw Daisy Johnson alive.
Daisy: And then?
Voss: Well, by all accounts, the city had been evacuated. No one there. After Quake walked in, 12.8 on the Richter scale, and the world cracked like an egg.
Daisy: How could I…
Voss: That’s the question. But when you look at this moment and all the suffering that took place after, you can’t help but wonder if it could’ve been prevented.
Robin: It’s too late to stop it.
Robin: Too late to stop it! There’s so much blood.
Fitz: May, I’ve had it. I’m done. She can’t control herself, she can’t stop seeing how people die, keeps muttering about it…
May: Hold on!
Fitz: She just described Jemma’s death. Why don’t you tell me how I’m supposed to live with that?
Robin: I thought I already told you.
May: You know she can’t help it. She sees death like her father, but she also sees a way out. That’s why you designed the machine.
Fitz: Oh, you don’t get it. Nothing we do matters. Because we can’t change time.
May: You don’t know that!
Fitz: Of course I do! Because we’ve tried! For all I know, we’ve tried a thousand times! Always ends the same. It’s like a record that keeps on skipping, and we are repeating this loop again and again and again!
May: Fitz, take a breath!
Fitz: And every time, Jemma dies. They all die. Robin can’t change it. Voss couldn’t change it. Even Daisy couldn’t change it. She saw the aftermath, and she still destroyed the world.
Robin: Daisy… Daisy! He has a knife.
Daisy: I’ll make sure this never happens.
Voss: We can tempt fate, or we can make sure you never get back.
Daisy: What is this?
Voss: It’s your life or the lives of billions. Aah! Aah!
Daisy: Robin, stay back!
Robin: This is the last day.
Voss: I was hoping I could get to her, but if not I can’t have you give her the answers. I’m sorry. It’s the only option I have left.
Daisy: No, Robin!
May: Aah!
Coulson: Daisy.
May: Go. I’ll catch up.
Coulson: And here I thought we were getting along.
May: Oh, no. Robin. You’re okay. You’re… W-We’re gonna take care of you. Shh. You’re okay, you’re okay. You’re okay.
Robin: Oh. Mom?
May: I’m sorry. She’s not here, but I’ll stay with you.
Robin: You always promised you’d be here at the end.
Robin: Mom? Mom…
May: Everything all right, honey?
Robin: Can’t sleep.
May: Come here. You want to talk about it?
Robin: I wish I never got this power.
May: It’s a lot to have going on in your head.
Robin: Every night, I close my eyes and see people hurting, people dying. Even you.
May: I know. It’s okay.
Robin: You’re not afraid?
May: A little. But you’ll be there, by my side, just like I’ll be there for you in the end.
Robin: I don’t want to lose you, too.
May: We’re special. Remember. We never have to say goodbye.
May: I-I raised you?
Robin: After my mother was gone, we lived together.
May: Why me?
Robin: You weren’t afraid of what I could do. You always said I had a gift. And that one day I could help save the world.
Robin: I’m supposed to tell you something, how you can get back home.
May: That’s right, but not today. It’s too early. You tell me when we’re back on the Zephyr, years from now.
Robin: But you won’t remember me then.
May: Then you remind me. Remind me that I still have an important job to do. Remind me that…
Robin: You’re needed for more than you realize.
May: Robin… Robin, what am I supposed to do?
May: And when that day comes, you have to tell me how to get back. You tell me your vision of us saving the world.
Robin: But I’ve never seen that vision.
May: You will. I’ll stay here until you fall asleep, hmm?
Robin: Thanks, Mom.
Robin: I know you can save the world. You were right. I’ve seen it. I just haven’t lived it yet.
May: No. Robin, how do we get back?
Voss: When you destroy the world, you remember this moment. Remember I tried to stop you.
Robin: I think I can go back to sleep now.
May: This is what she meant. The day it all ends.
Flint: The Roaches are dead! You’re safe now!
Gretchen: Thank you.
Mack: This fight’s not over. If we want to survive, we can’t let Kasius pit us against each other anymore.
Elena: All right. Who’s first?
Daisy: I thought you’d be dead.
Deke: Yeah, I guess Voss didn’t want any more of my family’s blood on his hands.
Daisy: Your dad… Deke, I’m s… I’m so sorry.
Deke: I just hope Robin can help you find your answers.
Daisy: I think we’re on our own.
Fitz: To me, Robin was a little girl only days ago.
Simmons: We’re not meant to see a life like this, at its beginning and end. It’s too much.
Coulson: Maybe it makes us appreciate how short life really is.
Daisy: So, what now?
Deke: We live on this crashed airplane until the Kree or… or the roaches or the gravity storms finish us off.
Coulson: I think we can do better than that.
Daisy: Yeah, but at least that way, I don’t go back in time and quake the world apart.
May: We do go back. Robin told me how. We can save everyone. Just one question, though. Who’s Flint?
Kasius: They survived, then. I just pray the Destroyer of Worlds doesn’t encounter the Vrellnexians on the surface. Those creatures can be quite ravenous.
Sinara: My orders?
Kasius: Follow their trail. If you encounter any of the human survivors, you know their weakness. Show no mercy.
