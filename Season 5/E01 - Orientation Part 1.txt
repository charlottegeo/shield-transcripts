Man: Haven’t done one of these in a while. You? My wife thinks that I’m at a friend’s house for our fantasy draft. Doesn’t even occur to her that we’re in the middle of the season. Doesn’t even occur her.
Man 2: We left one sitting at the counter, sir.
Enoch: Yeah. Not on the list.
Enoch: And the coat pockets. Clean it up, please. Watch the clock. The moment is fast approaching, everybody.
Coulson: Is everyone all right?
Mack: Yeah, I think so.
Virgil: Are you out of your skull? What the hell are you doing, blowing the damn window?
Jones: I… It’s called improvisation.
Virgil: You suicidal? Do you want to be a vacancy?
Jones: I couldn’t see another way to kill that thing. We’re safe now, okay? Quit howling.
Virgil: The other guy I hired isn’t safe. He’s frozen in the vacuum of space.
Jones: Yeah, well, I’ll take his cut, too. Relax. You can keep his rations.
Coulson: Hi.
Jones: What in the hell?!
Coulson: Don’t shoot. Thanks.
Virgil: Oh, my God. My God, you’re here.
Coulson: That I’m slowly figuring out. Sorry, I-I think I might be a little confused.
Virgil: Disoriented, of course. It’s quite a journey. I didn’t know how you traveled here, but I knew it wasn’t gonna be first class. You’re here. Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. You’ve come to save us.
Coulson: Yeah, just to clarify, where is here, who is us, and from what?
Jones: Move! Let’s go! Is this the whole shipment, Viril?
Virgil: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Jones: Go!
Virgil: Where are the others?! Wait! Where are the others? You weren’t the only one to travel through, were you?
Coulson: I don’t think so. Um, I’m sorry, what was that?
Virgil: The gravitational flux must’ve messed with your entry. We got to wait for the rest of them, okay?
Jones: You’ll have to triple my tokens to get me to stay a minute longer. One of those Roaches gets us, you’ll pay me to shoot you in the head.
Virgil: Get back. Stay back. Shh!
Coulson: All right, all right, that’s enough. Can we… I’d like to know, if you don’t mind, what is happening here, please.
Virgil: Okay. Yeah. Sorry. I-I didn’t know how much you would know about our current situation coming in.
Coulson: Zero. Walk me through it like I’m a child, like I’m a foreign child. What was that thing?
Virgil: Right. Right. That was a Vrellnexian. We call them Roaches. They can surf gravity storms so they’d be able to breach a few years back. This level’s been sealed up ever since then. It’s my first time here.
Coulson: And who are you?
Virgil: Right, sorry. Stupid me. My name is Virgil. I’m the greeting party and a fan.
Coulson: Great to have a name, Virgil, but looking for big picture, here. I mean, who are you?
Virgil: I’m one of the true believers.
Coulson: Believers in what?
Virgil: In you.
Coulson: Mack.
Mack: You okay? What the hell is going on?
Coulson: I was about to find out.
Mack: Oh, my bad. I see a dirty-looking dude hovering over you with a crazy-looking gun. I acted on impulse. Where’d that rock send us?
Coulson: Well, I don’t have many details, but I do know we’re in space.
Mack: Yeah, that makes sense. That’s the one thing we haven’t done yet. All right, so, where’s everyone else?
Simmons: Wait. Yo-Yo. No, Yo-Yo, wait! It’s me.
Elena: Simmons?
Simmons: What on Earth… I’m lucky there were no knives.
Elena: What the hell were you doing with that mask, trying to give me a heart attack?
Simmons: Well, I wasn’t sure the air was safe in here. They were trying to get out. I thought maybe it was for air when I saw this mask on the ground, but I guess not.
Elena: Do you really… Is that the smartest thing?
Simmons: They’re already dead. There’s nothing to be scared of.
Elena: No. Of course not. Oh, that looks like Momia Juanita from the Incan…
Simmons: The Incan mummies, yeah. These people have been dead for a long while, but their bodies seem absent all interstitial fluid. It’s completely dehydrated them, preserving them.
Elena: Dehydrated how? Frozen?
Simmons: No. Drained.
Elena: Oh. “They’re already dead. There’s nothing to be scared of.” Really? What sucks a human dry?
Mack: Aliens.
Elena: Mack.
Mack: I’m happy to see you, too, but I’m not happy we’re here.
Simmons: Aliens.
Mack: Yep. Coulson’s 99 percent sure we’re in space.
Simmons: Not again. All right. Any idea which part of space we’re in?
Coulson: Uh, outer?
Elena: And you saw an alien?
Coulson: No. We saw what they can do.
Simmons: So we have no idea what kind of creature these people are trying to get away from.
Coulson: Question I’m asking is, who locked them in?
May: ‘Cause this wasn’t fun enough.
Mack: It’s stupid. Just stupid.
Coulson: All right. I get it.
Mack: Look, I’m just saying, what good is it having a state-of-the-art robotic hand if you don’t have it on you when you’re kidnapped by Martians?
Elena: Looks like he’s got both hands to me.
Mack: Ah, that’s his civvy hand. It’s just a prosthetic without all the cool doodads. It should’ve been a hook. At least you can stab things with a hook.
Coulson: Thought I was gonna be arrested.
Elena: So, wait, that one doesn’t have the blowtorch or the laser gun or anything?
Coulson: First of all, I’m not Inspector Gadget. And second of all, the authorities would’ve confiscated it. Prison’s bad enough without being down an appendage.
Mack: First rule of Boy Scouts is always come prepared.
Simmons: How were we supposed to prepare for this, Mack?
Mack: I don’t know. I mean, we got to be prepared for everything, apparently. Look, not a day ago, I was trapped inside a-a computer-generated mind prison, and now… You know what? You know what, Coulson? I’m out. I’m out. We get through this, I am packing it in.
Coulson: Sorry, Mack. You already quit years ago.
Mack: Yeah, well, I didn’t quit hard enough. Look, I am not comfortable at the pace at which we deal with new trials and tribulations.
Simmons: Believe it or not, Mack, this isn’t new for me. I’ve been hurled through space by a monolith before. Best we can do is keep our heads and apply the scientific method.
Coulson: That’s right. Learn what we can about our circumstances. So, are these people human?
Simmons: Humanoid, at least. Means we aren’t the first ones here. That’s good.
Coulson: Is it? We don’t exactly want to follow in their footsteps.
Simmons: They’ve got no I.D.s. Fury never said anything about deep-space outposts being developed, did he?
Coulson: There was nothing like this in his black box.
Elena: So, wait, S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t have a space division called S.P.E.A.R. or something? Really? I always thought you guys had people hiding on the moon.
Coulson: Hey! Wake up! Geez, Mack, how hard did you hit him?
Mack: What do you mean? As hard as I possibly could. Look, I-I don’t half-hit people. It’s a punch. That’s why it’s called a punch.
Simmons: What did he say before that?
Coulson: He said that we were coming here to serve a purpose.
Elena: As food?
Coulson: No. He said we were here to save them. Any idea what that is?
Simmons: No.
Coulson: Here we go. Well, looks like he’s from Earth.
Elena: Or he ate someone from Earth.
Simmons: So it is a human outpost.
Mack: Yeah, and, of course, it’s being overrun by creatures that suck out your innards. I should’ve been a fireman.
May: Aah!
Virgil: Hey. Hey. Uh… How long have I been out? We can’t… We can’t linger here.
Coulson: Yeah, sorry. Mack thought you were an imminent threat.
Virgil: Alphonso “Mack” Mackenzie. Oh, it’s good to meet you. How do you know me? Oh, I know all of you. Yo-Yo Rodriguez. Is it okay if I call you Yo-Yo?
Elena: No.
Virgil: Okay. Jemma Simmons, biochemistry. I’m sorry Fitz didn’t get to make the trip, but he is thinking of you.
Mack: Hey! How do you know us?
Virgil: I’ve been studying you for years, your history. I mean, I always believed. I mean, I had moments, but they… they tried to take that last bit away from me, but I always believed the stories were true.
Simmons: What stories?
Virgil: Well, this one, that you would… you would come.
Coulson: To save you, Virgil, from those aliens that were attacking?
Virgil: No, those… No. The… The Roaches are an anomaly, a glitch in the plan. Don’t be crazy. You’re not here to save me.
Coulson: Who, then?
Virgil: Humanity.
Mack: W-W–
Virgil: I’m sorry. This is a lot to dump on your plate, but how do you eat an elephant, right? This will make a lot more sense once I show you…
Coulson: Got to let that guy finish his sentence.
Coulson: Go. Go.
Elena: Go.
Daisy: Right?
Coulson: Yes, that was right, and not the only one.
Deke: I’ve been looking for you.
May: Aah!
Deke: You know, I didn’t want to hurt you, but the idea is starting to grow on me. I deserve better than this.
May: Tell that to the corpses.
Deke: Damn. I was not prepared for that, I got to admit. You pack a big punch for such a small package. I got to read the fine print next time. I hate wasting the charge on that thing. Honestly, I wasn’t trying to hurt you, but you had a lead pipe at the ready, and I can’t… Okay. I guess we’ll stick with the first impression.
May: I don’t know what you did to these people or why I was dragged here, but…
Deke: Save it. The less I know, the better.
Daisy: So, is there anything you want to fill us in on, Coulson? ‘Cause now’s the time.
Coulson: You know what I know.
Daisy: This doesn’t have anything to do with the little bargain that you made with the Ghost Rider?
Mack: Yeah, that thing doesn’t ride for free. There has to be some price.
Coulson: Nope. This is all new to me. Sorry. It’s… That’s just the reality.
Elena: Well, maybe this isn’t reality. Maybe someone put us back in the Framework and this is a simulation.
Daisy: Please, we have to shut up about that.
Coulson: My God, if I even think about that, my brain will explode.
Simmons: Again, let’s not just postulate. Let’s apply scientific principles and consider the evidence we have.
Mack: Look, this is magic, okay? Can we all agree there’s some magic at play?
Simmons: Magic is just science we don’t understand yet.
Mack: Ah, please. We just got zapped through space by Stonehenge, and we’re trying to rule out the involvement of a flame-headed demon from east L.A.? Science my ass. Now, let me see that gun. Maybe I can try to get it working.
Simmons: Fitz would agree, but, apparently, he didn’t get taken.
Daisy: No. At least, he wasn’t in the room with the monolith. I was the last to go through. I saw it all.
Simmons: Well, that’s some relief. He’s safe from this, better off than we are.
Daisy: Yeah. You okay?
Simmons: Fine. What, do you think he isn’t better off? He has to be.
Daisy: No, that’s not what I’m saying.
Simmons: Or that he did something drastic? He wouldn’t do that. He was right there with us at the diner.
Daisy: No, I’m not saying any of that. It’s just you guys are constantly torn apart.
Simmons: Cursed, as he would say. Well, I’m not afraid that he isn’t here. I’m thrilled. He’s no doubt working this problem, probably trying to get a message to us right now. Better for everyone he isn’t here.
Daisy: Yeah, well, May did get pulled through. I saw it. So we should find her.
Coulson: We should split up.
Mack: Oh, hell, no.
Elena: No, no. Yeah, let’s not do that.
Mack: We are sticking together 100 percent. Haven’t you ever seen an alien movie?
Daisy: Mack, it’s the best way to cover the most ground.
Mack: Okay, you see, you see, that’s exactly what they say before they get picked off one by one, and you know who the first one will be.
Daisy: It’s your call, boss.
Coulson: This has to be the coolest we’ve ever looked.
Deke: That ought to keep the Roaches away for a while. Smell drives them nuts, I think. But you kick me again, and I’m gonna leave you to be their dessert. Now, this is gonna hurt like hell, but it’s better than the other way we can do it. I don’t know where you flushed out of, but in this sector, you can’t go 10 feet without a Metric. Hey. Don’t move. One inch the wrong way, and you’re a vacancy.
Daisy: Yo-Yo, you want to scout up ahead?
Elena: All clear for now.
Coulson: Seems like it’s just a lot of work just to keep this place afloat.
Simmons: But it’s designed for humans to survive, atmosphere and simulated gravity, and the machinery seemed to be for reclaiming water, I think.
Coulson: Yeah, it looks man-made.
Simmons: Could possibly be a colony? Moving mankind to the stars? Maybe that’s what Virgil meant by “humanity.”
Coulson: I don’t know. That plasma gun wasn’t man-made, and I don’t think they could’ve built this place without some outside help. Got some serious miles on it.
Simmons: Decades by the look of it.
Coulson: Means this program would’ve had to have been started back in the, what, '80s with Howard Stark? That doesn’t feel right.
Mack: Yo-Yo found something.
Daisy: Nothing.
Elena: Nothing alive.
Coulson: Hey.
Elena: They didn’t get to her, did they?
Coulson: May would’ve put up a fight. And they left the other bodies here.
Daisy: “Water reclamation.”
Coulson: You were right, Jemma.
Simmons: I figured it out using magic.
Daisy: I can try and find a layout and track May.
Simmons: It’s in English. They’re tracking debris fields called “frozen oceans.” They’re collecting water from ice in space. This is a colony.
Coulson: Which means unless they all came through a monolith…
Daisy: Then we’re close enough to Earth for people to travel here.
Mack: And we can get home.
Simmons: Yes, but just as important, collecting ice means they have a spacecraft, and if they have a spacecraft, they must have a laser-based rapid-transmission system. If we can find the ship and fly above the debris field…
Coulson: We can send a message.
Simmons: … we can send a message to Fitz back on Earth.
Daisy: Okay, okay, so if I can find a layout, find a ship, find May, it’s a start. This interface looks similar to… Coulson, do you recognize this language?
Coulson: No. I don’t think humans are running this place after all.
Daisy: Mack? Yo-Yo?
Kree (in Kree): We’ll leave these transgressors to the floor chief? To use as he needs. He should be interested that they’ve removed their Metrics.
Daisy: Hey. What are you gonna do with our friends?
Kree: Whatever we want. Experiment. They knew the rule, and they broke it.
Daisy: They’re not gonna make it easy for you.
Kree: No. They’ll beg for their lives as you humans always do. I’ve done 22 rotations, and I have never observed anything else.
Mack: It’s great to get some alone time with you, but I really wish you had run away with your super-speed instead.
Elena: Yeah, you forget I snap back to where I started. Sometimes it’s very useful, but other times, it’s super annoying.
Mack: You speak English?
Kree: Of course.
Mack: Let her go. She didn’t do anything.
Kree: I said we speak English. That doesn’t mean I want to hear it.
Mack (in Spanish): How do you think Papa Smurf here feels about a little Espanõl?
Coulson: Okay. New theory.
Simmons: The Kree have been abducting humans to this outpost for years.
Daisy: Running experiments?
Simmons: Well, their genetic work in creating Inhumans is well-known. Maybe they’re doing more of the same.
Daisy: Yeah, well, I’m not gonna wait around to find out. So…
Coulson: May.
Deke: Buddy! Just go with it. I’ve been looking everywhere for you guys. Man What a mess back there, huh? These poor suckers. Virgil, you know, from R&R? He was trying to scam these guys out of some tokens. This one came running to me begging for help, the poor thing. When I get my hands on that no-good louse, he’s gonna have some explaining to do. So where is Virgil, anyway?
Coulson: He’s dead.
Deke: Good. Good. Got what he deserved, then, didn’t he, for trying to drag these poor transfers up from processing into the wet works just to steal their Metrics. So he’s just Roach food then, huh?
Coulson: Oh, yeah.
Deke: One more vacancy, right?
Coulson: That’s what I was gonna say.
Deke: Guys, what did I say about trusting Virgil, huh? We went over this. What did I say?
Simmons: Don’t trust Virgil.
Daisy: Not to trust him.
Deke: God, you repeated it back to me, and we said back, it was like a pass-and-catch thing. Look, I really appreciate your help with these guys, but I can take them off your hands, and then I’ll slip you a few extra tokens for your trouble. Listen, I’ll be… I’ll be honest with you, man to more than a man. If I can’t get these guys back to processing at warp speed, I am gonna be in some pretty hot water. So I know it’s not ideal, but… Look, if you… if you come by the gallery for an hour or two, I’ll make it worth your while, all right? All good, gang. So, single file.
Mack (in Spanish): Feel free to wiggle out of those restraints any time now, darling.
Elena (in Spanish): Shut-up. Stop provoking them. But your Spanish is so much better.
Mack (in Spanish): Spanish was mandatory at Hope’s school.
Kree (in Kree): He’s holding up well for a human. He might be well fitted for fighting in the Crater. He’s a good size. He could make a nnice gift for Kasius?
Kree 2 (in Kree): That could earn us some points. Good thinking. (in English) We’ll spare you to provide us greater satisfaction than killing you would bring. She’ll pay that price for you.
Mack: Stop! Stop! No! No!
Coulson: You good?
May: Banged up but okay. We in space?
Coulson: That’s affirmative.
May: Copy that.
Deke: What the hell happened to Virgil? The Roaches get him?
Coulson: Sorry to say. Was he a friend?
Deke: Acquaintance. He owed me a ton of tokens for this job.
Simmons: Job?
Deke: All he said was that he wanted to hide some people. That’s not unheard of. So I was hired to supply the Metrics and swap them out, but you guys don’t even have Metrics, which means that you don’t have the tokens to cover Virgil’s end, so have fun.
Daisy: Hey, wait, wait. We need your help. We need to find our friends.
Deke: Your friends? Your friends attacked a Kreeper. They’re as good as gone. Those blues are bred to kill, so you just you make your peace with it.
Coulson: We’ll take our chances. Listen, if you could just help us find them and then get to the spacecraft…
Deke: You mean the Trawler? To do what? The only pilot I knew was Virgil, may he rest in peace, apparently. So best of luck to all you guys, but mine’s running out.
Coulson: You got a name?
Deke: Deke.
Coulson: Well, Deke, we just wanted pie, and now we don’t know where we are or what’s going on, and we finally found someone who does, so you’re not walking away.
Simmons: Where’s the Trawler?
Deke: Take a lift down to level nine. You can’t miss it.
Coulson: May, take Simmons. Get that spacecraft in the air. Send out the signal. Daisy and I will find Mack and Yo-Yo.
Daisy: No, no, wait. You stay here. What? I’ve got two good fighters down there once I get the restraints off. I’ll be fine. We can’t lose our leader again. We need answers.
Coulson: You want me to stay here and grill this guy?
Daisy: Find out where the hell and what the hell, sir.
Deke: Good plan.
Coulson: What do the Kree want with us, Deke?
Deke: All they ever want, submission.
May: Whoa. How many Kree live here?
Simmons: Too many. Think about it. The Kree have been studying humans for years, moving here in large numbers.
May: Kree who were bred to kill.
Simmons: Bred to kill and living within striking distance of Earth. This isn’t an outpost, May.
May: It’s a staging ground. They’re planning an invasion.
Kree (in Kree): At some point her arms should just snap off.
Coulson: What do you mean “submission?” Are the Kree planning some sort of attack?
Deke: Attack on whom exactly?
Coulson: Humans.
Deke: Why would they do that?
Mack: Stop! Please! I’ll do anything! Just stop!
Kree: Quiet, or we’ll change our minds about you.
Simmons: Can you start her up?
May: That’s the ignition port, I think, but, uh, we obviously don’t have the key.
Simmons: What are the chances of them leaving it in here? Wait.
May: Well, that worked out.
Simmons: Have you ever flown a spaceship?
May: You know the answer to that question.
Simmons: I have no words.
May: Don’t need them.
Coulson: So, then why did the Kree build this place?
Deke: They didn’t build the bunker. Humans did. Why don’t you know these things? Even in waste processing, they know the history… You’re not from processing, are you?
Coulson: No. I was enjoying a meal, and then I was taken and zapped to this place. I’m from Earth.
Deke: Yeah, well, that would be the one thing that I do know, wing nut. But from where? What area?
Coulson: Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
Deke: Are you high on something? Can I have some?
Mack: You okay? Thought you were gonna lose these for a second there.
Elena: I was starting to picture myself with two hooks.
Daisy: Wait. Wait. Yeah, help me get him up. We can gain access now, maybe talk to the Trawler ship, find their location.
May: We need to get up off this debris field if we want a clear signal.
Simmons: Yeah, if I can figure out how to send one. I mean, the good news is, I-I recognize some of these constellations, so we’re… we’re at least in our own galaxy.
Coulson: That doesn’t make sense. How long ago did they build this place, and when did you first come here?
Deke: I don’t know. They built it 90-some-odd years ago, minimum. But I… what do you mean “come here?” I was born here.
Elena: Que pasa, Mack?
Mack: These… These filtration systems, they weren’t designed for this. They’ve been repurposed.
Daisy: Yeah, I feel like this machine’s out of its element, too. I found the coordinates to this place, but it’s listing our location in longitude and latitude.
Mack: The postcard.
Coulson: 90 years ago? That… That’s impossible. The tech in here couldn’t have been developed in the '20s.
Deke: Wait. No Metrics, no scars, Wisconsin, pie. Tell me again about when you were taken.
Coulson: We were… We were sitting in our favorite diner just off Columbus Drive.
Deke: No, not… not where. When? What year?
Coulson: That monolith was different, wasn’t it? We didn’t travel through space.
May: Are you seeing what I’m seeing?
Simmons: I know, May. I recognize all of these constellations.
May: I meant that.
Simmons: No reason to send a message back to Earth. We’re already here.
