Kasius: I rescued humanity. Did you know that? What you may not know is how much I’ve sacrificed to do it. Before I arrived, this place was nothing but a wreckage, the rotted shell of a dead organism. But I saw it for what it could be. I had vision. And now, thanks to you, that vision has finally come to fruition.
Daisy: You’ve taken my blood. What more do you need from me?
Kasius: Despite all I did for these humans, I found them clinging to their gods, their fairy tales, one of which was Quake. The Old Ones, rest their souls, they used to tell the story of how S.H.I.E.L.D. would return one day from the past to save them. Now here you are.
Daisy: Not my choice.
Kasius: Yet you show up at the exact same time as another human, with no marks on her wrist and a skill set beyond her station. Jemma.
Daisy: I know you’re trying to say something, but I’m just not sure what.
Kasius: Perhaps you are more than a fairy tale. How many of you are here?
Daisy: No one else.
Kasius: I want to believe you, Daisy. May I call you “Daisy?” It’s a lot less formal than “Destroyer of Worlds.” You see, I have my own interpretation of the fairy tale. I think you’re here to help me.
Daisy: That seems unlikely.
Kasius: Does it? Word of your presence has piqued much interest. In fact, bidders are on their way. And with the price I’ll fetch for you, I’ll finally have the means to leave this horrendous place once and for all.
Daisy: What makes you think I’d go along with that?
Kasius: Because, of course, your friend’s face is so beautiful. Don’t you want to make sure it stays that way?
Coulson: What are you doing here?
May: They shut down all the Trawler flights. No idea why.
Coulson: So now they even have the pilots working as crushers, I guess. That’s a little slang I picked up here. “Crusher.” It’s when you…
May: Phil. I get “crusher.” Anything on Daisy?
Coulson: Nothing. Just when we have a chance of getting answers on the surface, two of our people go missing.
Mack: Hey.
Coulson: Anything?
Mack: Been checking with the guys working the docking bays to see if maybe Daisy hopped a ship to move between levels, but I don’t know.
May: I assume she didn’t.
Mack: Is it time to panic yet?
Elena: Possibly. I’ve covered every square inch of this floor. No sign of Daisy.
Coulson: I don’t like this. She could be captured. She could…
Grill: You’re not here to stand around and gossip.
Mack: We were all talking. Why me?
Grill: ‘Cause you’re bigger. Makes it funnier. Keep working! Big man downstairs is entertaining. An intergalactic auction means that we have to provide more iron for Kasius to sell off. So we are working triple shifts. Hey, I answer to the fat cat Blues, same as you. Only I have to go and explain to them why we are not meeting our quotas. So make sure we do by the end of today. Except you. You’re with me.
Grill: Guy’s name is Gunner. Thinks he’s a tough guy. Owes me a lot of tokens. I need you to rough him up.
Mack: Oh. You need me to do what?
Grill: Beat his ass. Look, I got it on good authority that Gunner is waiting on a package from Level 35. Now, that is a high-security, Kreepers-only technology floor. He’s in debt to me and getting tech from the Blues? I don’t like that.
Mack: But you already got enforcers. Why do you need me to do it?
Grill: Well, I had Zev. He was a snake. Now he’s roach food. And have you looked in a mirror? You’re a beast. Go be one.
Ben: Excuse me. They grow it.
Daisy: Uh… What?
Ben: You’re wondering where the meat comes from. There’s some kind of lab where they grow it or something.
Daisy: Was that just a lucky guess, or did you just read my thoughts?
Ben: I heard them, really. That’s what I got after Terrigenesis.
Daisy: You’re Inhuman. That’s how you anticipated the moves, which is not cool, by the way reading people’s minds without permission.
Ben: I hear what I hear. Believe me, it’s kind of a relief when they turn it off. And there we go.
Tye: All right, everyone out. Not you. No, you’re something special. You get a private viewing.
Coulson: Yeah, I don’t think you have a choice, Mack, if we want to keep Grill off our backs.
Mack: So we gotta go rough up this guy Gunner. Yeah. Makes as much sense as anything else in this place.
Coulson: Maybe you and Yo-Yo can just talk to him. Avoid the all-out assault.
Elena: Both of us?
Coulson: I’m already missing two agents. I’m going with Mack’s philosophy that we stick together here.
Mack: Finally.
Coulson: As long as you’re back before Grill, we should be fine. And it gets us an opportunity.
May: Yeah. That’s you and me.
Coulson: Yup. Grill just tipped us off to Level 35, Kree technology? We have to check that out.
May: We have no weapons, no intel.
Coulson: Well, I’m hoping Level 35 gets us an edge, or at least something that’ll help us survive on the surface till we can find Virgil’s radio pal.
Mack: You got access to a secure floor?
Coulson: No, but I think I know a guy.
Daisy: So you’re making them fight? Inhumans? That’s what this place is for, fighting For entertainment?
Tye: Not just for entertainment. For profit. Kasius’ profit.
Daisy: What does he want?
Tye: A demonstration of your skills.
Daisy: Maybe I don’t feel like performing on cue today. Unless you’ve got peanuts.
Tye: Maybe you should get in the mood. Fast. For your friend.
Daisy: Okay. Fine.
Tye: That wasn’t what I meant.
Basha: I had no idea that you had the Destroyer of Worlds in your stable.
Kasius: Oh, did I forget to mention it? Word’s gotten around, and a host of traders are on their way presently.
Basha: Well, perhaps I can make a preemptive bid for her now.
Kasius: Oh, Basha. That would be lovely.
Basha: I can make a far greater offer than any…
Kasius: Unfortunately, discussion of price will take place over dinner. And since you so prefer dining on your own ship, I fear that takes you out of the running, no? Ah, well. Safe journey home to your… what was the colorful phrase you used? “Grim little rock.”
Deke: She seems nice.
Kasius: I suppose you’re here for payment.
Deke: Well, I did bring you Quake.
Kasius: So you did. Here.
Deke: Is that Rhodium?
Kasius: You have an eye for high-value metals. This’ll be worth more than all your credits upstairs.
Deke: Yes, it will.
Kasius: I want to thank you for bringing her to me. But Sinara is concerned about the prophecy, that others from the past might have come, as well.
Deke: Guess that means you are, too.
Kasius: Prophecies are hard to decipher. Could be 2 people, could be 20.
Deke: Well, maybe the prophecy wouldn’t be such a mystery if you didn’t kill everyone that knew anything about it.
Kasius: Yes. Life is full of regrets. Still.
Deke: How can I help?
Kasius: Should you come across any additional time travelers or anyone who helped them, I’d be grateful and generous.
Deke: Let me see what I can find for you.
Daisy: Hey. So, you’re telling me you don’t see the whole picture? I’d fill you in, but I feel like you already know.
Ben: I’ve read Tye’s mind. Of course I know.
Daisy: The Ceremonies. They are making Inhumans fight each other. And people bid on them? Are you okay with this?
Ben: I’ve come to terms with it.
Daisy: And everyone else?
Ben: The others don’t know. They can never know.
Daisy: Wait. What? They have the right to fight back.
Ben: But we have to.
Daisy: You can’t just sit here and do nothing.
Ben: You can’t tell them. You can’t tell anyone.
Daisy: You’ve gotta make better sense than this, ‘cause I mean…
Ben: If the others find out, they can’t do what has to be done. We do this, demonstrate our powers, and go with whomever buys us because our families get compensated once we’re gone.
Daisy: You mean they get paid to sell you.
Ben: I mean they have a better shot at survival. Survival is everything.
Daisy: This is insane.
Ben: This is life. Otherwise, our families could pay the price. You have people you care about, I heard that much. If you care about them, I suggest you play the game. And if they pit us against each other, I suggest you try to win. 'Cause I will.
Deke: Hey. Come on.
Coulson: Sorry. We need to talk.
Deke: Say, “Deke. How you doing? You look really good. Can we have a word?” See? It’s not that hard. I was coming to find you guys, anyway, 'cause I haven’t seen you in a little while.
Coulson: I was hoping Daisy was with you. Last we heard, she was looking for you.
Deke: Yeah. She found me. I was just with her a couple hours ago. And it’s… it’s… it’s all good. I-I helped her onto a lower medical floor. It’s where we think your other friend is.
May: She never came back or checked in.
Deke: She said something about no further contact, spy stuff. How’d she put it? “Silent mode?”
May: Going dark.
Deke: Yeah. That. And I told her that you’d wonder, and she said, “Get out of my way. This is what I do. My friend’s life is on the line. I’ll figure something out.”
Coulson: Yeah. That sounds like Daisy.
Deke: Sorry I don’t have her. I wish I did.
Coulson: It’s all right. We came for you. What do you know about Level 35?
Deke: Every few floors, there’s a secure Kree level. Level 4 is holding, that’s where I met you fine folks. And then Level 17 is engineering. But I’ve never seen 35. Why?
Coulson: We’re hoping to find some Kree technology. Anything that’ll help us. We need to investigate the surface.
Deke: The surface. Yeah, why not? No, yeah, it’ll take too long to get to the center of the sun.
Coulson: I know it’s an unconventional plan.
Deke: What is actually wrong with you people that you keep going places you are not supposed to be going? Are you all very suicidal?
May: We have reasons.
Deke: Not good ones.
Coulson: We do now. Virgil’s time in the Trawler? He was communicating with the surface.
Man: Virgil. Come in. Do you read? We haven’t heard from you in three days. Please respond. Have you secured the delegation?
Deke: Those people are all dead. Kasius thinks they’re all dead.
Coulson: I know.
Deke: I-I need to go get a few things.
May: Oh, so now you’re interested?
Deke: Those people up there, if we can find them, that’s in everyone’s best interest.
Elena: Is that Gunner?
Mack: That’s Gunner. Try to walk casual.
Elena: If you can see me, that’s me walking casual.
Mack: That’s fair. But try not to do anything rash.
Elena: Do you want to talk about it or make not very subtle comments all day? Spit it out, turtleman.
Mack: So, we’re beating people up now? It’s bad enough what we’ve already done.
Elena: Are you talking about Grill’s right-hand man? I did it to save lives, your life.
Mack: Yeah. Now the guy’s dead.
Elena: And I’m sorry about that, but I choose you over him every time.
Mack: Yeah. I just don’t want us losing ourselves here. Look what happened to Fitz in the Framework.
Elena: This is different.
Mack: Yeah, I know it’s different. This place is real.
Elena: Yeah, exactly. Real danger, real violence. We protect ourselves to survive.
Mack: Yeah. Do we have to hurt people to do it?
Elena: If we’re being practical, maybe.
Mack: Yeah, well, I was raised do unto others as you would have them do to you.
Elena: Yeah, you were raised in the suburbs. I didn’t grow up in Naperville. I grew up in Potosí, a city just like this. It operates on fear.
Mack: Yeah. And you hated it there.
Elena: Yeah, but I learned from it. We don’t have to hurt him to scare him. Look at that bastard. He owes money, and he’s still trying to get more. Maybe he does need a shake-up. And don’t worry, we won’t lose ourselves. I promise.
Kasius: Jemma. I’m thirsty.
Kasius: The truth is not a relative concept, is it? A subjective conceit? Then imagine my disappointment to discover you and Jemma did, in fact, hide the truth. Sinara said Jemma had a friend who assisted in saving a life, seemed to know her, seemed to understand.
Daisy: I would ask Simmons, but she can’t hear me for some twisted reason. I already told you.
Kasius: Please. I can’t abide untruths. And it’s unnecessary when we can get to the facts ever so quickly. Of course, there’s no way I can tell for certain if you’re being honest. But he can.
Daisy: I already told you. It’s just me and Simmons.
Kasius: Jemma, who was the woman helping you when you helped Reese?
Simmons: I have no idea. There were lots of people in The Exchange that day. I don’t know who they all were.
Ben: They’re telling the truth. Both of them.
Kasius: Did you come through time together or separately?
Daisy: I don’t understand why that matters.
Kasius: Because the prophecy spoke of S.H.I.E.L.D. And if they did, you may not even be aware of it.
Daisy: We came through together. No one else. Just us.
Kasius: Very well. Tell us that miraculous story. Spare no detail.
Daisy: We were alone. We lost one. Jeffrey Mace. Fitz killed him. One of our team members. Fitz was Jemma’s… they were in love. And he couldn’t handle it. Honestly, none of us really could. He was gonna leave S.H.I.E.L.D., so I took Jemma out to talk alone. We went to a diner. We were just talking when these guys came in, and they grabbed us. They knocked us out, and, boom, we ended up here.
Kasius: Jemma, now you tell me the same story, how you two ended up here. And, Jemma? It had best be a story in perfect accord with hers.
Simmons: I was so distraught after our last mission in the Framework, when Fitz killed Mace and Fitz was worse. He decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. It seemed our team was breaking up. Daisy took me to a diner to talk alone. To make me feel better, I guess. And then these men came. They grabbed us, they knocked us out and we ended up here.
Kasius: Good, then.
Kasius: I share your concern, but we have preparations to make. And, remember, you’re not the only one working on this.
Coulson: I imagine it’s not as simple as taking the elevator down to 35.
Deke: No. We can’t access it. But I can get us in below it, find my way in. I’ll call the elevator from Level 35 itself. You guys hang tight.
Coulson: You trust him?
May: You know me better than that.
Deke: Welcome to Level 35. Yeah, well, hold the applause.
Daisy: Hi. What the hell just happened?
Ben: I covered for you.
Daisy: Yeah, but how?
Ben: My Inhuman power, it isn’t just reading minds.
Daisy: You can let other people read your mind, too. So you told Simmons what I said.
Ben: Yeah. They don’t know I can do that.
Daisy: What about playing the game?
Ben: Daisy, listen, it wasn’t just your minds in there. That was as close as I’ve ever been to Kasius. My first chance to read his.
Daisy: Right. So, what did you see?
Ben: Shame. He hates this place. When his gala is all done, Kasius isn’t just leaving, he wants it all erased.
Daisy: He’s gonna destroy the station?
Ben: Along with everyone on it. My family. Every family. But I could also see how powerful he thinks you are and how powerful you know you are.
Daisy: Good. Maybe it’s time we change the rules on his game.
Elena: Hey.
Gunner: Who… What are you?
Elena: Grill sent us. He wants his money.
Gunner: Yeah? Screw Grill. I told him he’d get his money, and he will. He thinks you’re gonna scare me?
Elena: I should. Because if I don’t, big man here will.
Coulson: What is this place?
May: Lab. Maybe R&D.
Coulson: R&D. That works.
Gunner: Tell Grill to relax. I’m putting it together. No one wants any trouble.
Elena: Good. Then don’t cause any, 'cause I don’t know what my friend will do.
Gunner: Your friend just needs to calm down.
Mack: Take it easy. Take it easy. Now, this package you’re waiting for, you know we can make it disappear.
Gunner: What did you just say?
Coulson: If this place is all science, then there’s got to be something here we can use. We just need to find it. Roaches?
Deke: No.
Mack: I’m saying if you try anything, it wouldn’t be hard for us to go after this package of yours and make it so it never gets to you.
Gunner: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can’t do that.
Mack: Hey. Things go missing all the time.
Gunner: I swear, I’ll kill you.
May: Wait. What is that?
Coulson: It’s the package meant for Gunner, isn’t it?
Deke: Probably. There’s been a lot of vacancies lately. Must be time to start filling them.
Gunner: What kind of man makes a threat so low? You’re sick.
Mack: Just pay Grill, and no one will take your stuff.
Elena: Mack.
Mack: But if you don’t, we’ll take that package, and we’ll throw it in the crushing mill.
Elena: Mack, look.
Gunner: Who threatens a child? Who would threaten to tear a baby away from someone when the chance is so rare?
Mack: Sorry. I didn’t know. I didn’t see.
Gunner: Kids are scarce here because of people like you who only understand violence and death! I hope you never get the privilege. You’d mess it up, anyway. People like you don’t deserve a child.
Elena: Mack! Mack, no! Mack! Mack, no! Mack! Mack!
Gunner: See?
Coulson: They’re using newborns as a commodity?
Deke: How do you think things are done around here? It’s the only way anyone can have kids.
Coulson: I’m sorry, “the only way?”
Deke: People don’t get pregnant anymore.
Coulson: Super. And the vibe goes full-dystopian. What did they do? Sterilize the whole population?
Deke: We think they do it through the food so they can decide who has children.
Coulson: How long?
Deke: They’ve always tried to control it. I was one of the last ones that was born the old-fashioned way, until Kasius decided that it was easiest to just…
Coulson: Create the children themselves. But why? Are they trying to diversify the human population?
Deke: Kasius doesn’t care about humans. He just wants to increase the genetic chances they turn. To Inhumans. They’re much more valuable that way.
Coulson: Valuable? Valuable to whom? Deke, what is he auctioning off down there?
Deke: You think he’s selling rocks? The whole process is pretty upsetting, so we try not to think about the details.
May: Phil. I found something.
Coulson: What is it?
May: Him.
Deke: Okay. Ow.
Coulson: May?
May: The lab got a new sample they’re supposed to use for Inhuman genes.
Coulson: Daisy. And they’ve been holding her since yesterday.
Deke: Is that what that thing says? Because if you…
Coulson: Even though you said you were helping her this morning. Why would you lie about Daisy unless you sold her out?
Deke: Okay, well, this is probably the part where I should explain.
Coulson: No. This is the part where May breaks your face. You explaining, kind of secondary.
Deke: Okay. You’re mad. I get that.
May: Are they using her for breeding?
Deke: It seems that way, but that’s not why Kasius wanted her.
Coulson: So you did sell her out.
Deke: Yes, but it’s more… Hey, fellas, we actually… we were just got a little bit turned around. Uh, is this Level 35? We were actually looking… Oh, okay, we’re fighting.
Deke: Ohh! More Kreepers.
May: Phil, you take Deke upstairs. Make him talk. I’ll hold them off.
Coulson: I’m not leaving you here alone.
May: Go.
Coulson: May. Your leg. You’re still not 100%.
May: I got this. Go.
Coulson: Okay. The bleeding’s stopped. How’s it feel?
Deke: It’s fine.
Coulson: Good. Not too tight?
Deke: No. Snug. Not too tight.
Coulson: Okay. In that case…
Deke: Ohh. I really need you people to stop doing that.
Coulson: Where’s Daisy?
Deke: Look, I had to do that.
Coulson: Oh, you had to?
Deke: Yeah, I had to. People had died, and Kasius wouldn’t have hesitated to kill hundreds more, and Daisy didn’t even seem to care, at all. So, trust me, it’s safer with her out of the mix.
Coulson: I don’t trust you.
Deke: Well, I did what needed to be done.
Coulson: Oh, please. That wasn’t the first time you went for a payday. You weren’t out to save lives. You made a profit.
Deke: The two aren’t mutually exclusive.
Coulson: So don’t pretend your motives were pure.
Deke: Oh, please. There’s so much you don’t even know that…
Coulson: And now you’re doing it again, aren’t you? You don’t want to help those people on the surface. You want to turn them over to Kasius for…
Deke: You don’t know me, man! I was nine, okay? When my mother got dragged away and murdered. Kasius got rid of all the elders, all the smart people, and she was one of them. And after she was gone, my dad took up the cause. He carried the torch for her. And as I got older, I begged him not to. I said that they were gonna get him, too, and I was right. He got sent to the roaches, just like the rest of them. That’s why it was pretty strange to hear his voice.
Coulson: That was your father?
Deke: If he’s alive up there, I don’t just want you to succeed, I need to be there when you do.
Coulson: Oh. That’s a good story. But stories are what you do, so excuse me if I don’t buy it just yet. You wanna help us, you’re gonna need to prove it.
Deke: How?
Coulson: Let’s start with the payment you got for Daisy. Someone else needs that more than you do.
Deke: That’s more painful than getting stabbed. That buy me some trust?
Coulson: It buys you some time. But for now, I think we’re safer with you out of the mix.
Deke: Hey, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Hey! Hey!
Coulson: Any word from May?
Elena: No.
Deke: Hey!
Elena: Wanna be careful standing around. Grill’s gonna be back soon. Are you ready to talk yet?
Mack: There’s nothing to say. I mean, there I was, telling you not to lose yourself. Who doesn’t love irony, right?
Elena: Mack, Gunner hit your weak spots. Of course you reacted.
Mack: I just couldn’t listen to him.
Elena: He doesn’t know what you’ve lost or how great of a dad you are.
Mack: But what if I’m not?
Elena: Not what?
Mack: A great dad.
Elena: Mack, please. Stop it.
Mack: No. When Hope died, the real Hope, she never came home, and, still, it took me weeks before I could walk into her nursery and take everything away, but I did it, eventually.
Elena: It must have been hard.
Mack: But this Hope, my Hope, in the Framework. She, uh… This is harder. I miss her so much. It’s so much worse. Imagine that. I survived the pain of losing my real child, but I can’t get over the pain of losing a fake one, so what kind of a father does that make me? Maybe Gunner was right about me. Maybe I really am already lost. I…
Elena: Hey. Hope might not have been real, but your love for her was. And that makes you a great father and a good man. We’ll get through this place intact. Together. Okay?
Grill: Hey, Monster Mack! Gunner just paid me off. Whoo! Seems like you’re twice the beast I thought you were. Glad to have you, Mack. You fit right in.
Kasius: And you’ve dealt with our newest guest?
Ava: Your gracious host Kasius would like to say a few words of welcome.
Kasius: It is truly my pleasure to invite you to this wondrous place, the last bastion of a species, a place I’ve been proud to call home for so long. You are the first to arrive for an exhibition of unbridled powers to excite the senses. All leading up to our main event. One powerful Inhuman, long thought gone, now here to enrich one lucky patron’s life. Quake, Destroyer of Worlds. Someone, maybe someone in this room right now, will win this prize. Her power will be your power. So, are there any requests as we begin?
Fitz: Forget your exhibition. She’s the Destroyer of Worlds. She should fight to the death.
