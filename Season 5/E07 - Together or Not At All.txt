Simmons: Find me some clothes.
Daisy: What’s the plan, Fitz?
Fitz: Uh, I have a ship. We get there, then comes the plan.
Fitz: Hey, how’s your head?
Daisy: I’ll tell you when the ringing stops. By the way, “fight to the death?” Really?
Fitz: Yeah, well, I had to make a splashy entrance.
Daisy: Yeah, well, you could have jumped in the octagon yourself, then.
Fitz: Well, wouldn’t be fair. I do push-ups now. Double digits. So…
Simmons: You have no idea how good it is to see you. You’re here with a spaceship. Seems impossible.
Fitz: Nothing is impossible anymore.
Simmons: Full story later.
Fitz: Yeah, there will be pints.
Simmons: There will be gin. Oh! Oh, my God!
Fitz: Whoa.
Daisy: Her implant. They must be messing with it.
Fitz: Well, what… what… what do we do?
Daisy: Get it out.
Fitz: Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Jemma. Jemma. This is gonna hurt. I’ve got it. I’ve got it.
Simmons: Aah! Aaaah!
Daisy: We got to go! Come on.
Fitz: There’s the ship. Just got to get past…
Daisy: Don’t tell me that was…
Fitz: Our way out.
Kasius: Is it noticeable?
Faulnak: It should be. Scars are badges of honor for the victor. But as expected, your priorities are misplaced. What news of the Destroyer?
Kasius: She has no power, no ship, and nowhere to run. Have patience, dear brother.
Faulnak: Patience is a feeble cover for inaction. Double the guard. Have them sweep floor by floor…
Kasius: While your expertise is appreciated, I have the matter under control. There’s a system in place, and it has served me well. Sinara will end this inconvenience. As you saw by her display in the Crater, she is the most capable warrior in my employ.
Faulnak: Your best has proven inadequate. You remember my man, Maston-Dar, here. He’ll make quick work of this.
Maston-Dar: A Terran weapon.
Faulnak: Of course. Bring any human weaponry you possess. Maston finds it unfair hunting primitives with anything but their own primitive armaments. Show them how we spill blood. And, uh, find the girl in the process.
Vicar: This is the price of hiding Inhumans. Continue to keep your mouths shut, and you’ll end up dead, too.
Coulson: This is bigger than a renewal. It’s a direct threat.
Mack: These people will give us up in a heartbeat if it’ll save their own lives.
Coulson: These Kree may be cruel, but they’re not stupid. It’s only a matter of time till this trail of bodies leads them right to us. It’s time for us to make a move.
Kasius: Finally. There’s work to be done. Faulnak loves to play general. Let him. I need him to be satiated. He’s the gatekeeper to my father, to our freedom.
Sinara: “Our?”
Kasius: Don’t be dramatic.
Sinara: He gives the orders now, no?
Kasius: I see. You’re resentful because I allowed him to throw you in the Crater. Well, look at you, no worse for wear. You held your own against the Destroyer of Worlds, as I knew you would. Your strength has never let me down. And now I ask for you to lend it to me once again. We’re so close, Sinara, to freedom from this place. Restored to glory together.
Sinara: You’re begging. It’s repulsive.
Kasius: I’m imploring you to think. To use reason. I must appease my brother, and I cannot allow him to steal my reward. I will keep him entertained. We’ll let his man chase her tail while you figure out what’s in her head. Where will she go?
Daisy: So, the last time I saw Yo-Yo and the others, they were at a salvage yard on one of the upper floors.
Fitz: How you feeling, Jemma?
Simmons: Oh, somewhere between motion-sick and… Ohh! That’s not helping.
Daisy: Damn it. Wait. Fitz, give me a boost.
Simmons: I’m just happy not to be standing still. Feels good to be on the run.
Fitz: Together.
Enoch: Hello! That is the third Vrellnexian I have eliminated in pursuit of you! Not to toot my own horn, as you would say.
May: I would never say that. Who the hell are you?
Enoch: My name is Enoch. Fitz sent me.
May: Fitz? How were you not eaten by those things?
Enoch: They have no interest in me, as I have no tender insides for them to extract.
May: I thought Fitz was done building robots.
Enoch: I am not a robot. I am a sentient Chronicom from the constellation you know as Cygnus. I am here to aid you, you who will save humanity, Melinda May, Jemma Simmons, Phillip J. Coulson.
May: Say that name again?
Enoch: Phillip J. Coulson.
May: You’re the son of a bitch from that diner who got us into this whole mess! You… Aah!
Enoch: I am here to get you out of this whole mess. It would appear I got here just in time.
May: I’m managing.
Enoch: Have you properly diagnosed the extent of your injuries?
May: Bilateral tear of the quadricep.
Enoch: By all accounts, you should not be standing. Are you a doctor?
May: No. I’m a fighter.
Enoch: Still? It may be time for a career change. There’s a gravity storm approaching.
May: They’re moving away. Are they afraid of gravity storms or you?
Enoch: The Vrellnexians ride the gravity storms, but I don’t think it’s me. I think they’re afraid of something else.
May: Aah! Aah! Aah! No! No!
Maston-Dar: Halt.
Man: Aah. Aah!
Maston-Dar: The Destroyer, where is she?
Man: I-I don’t know. I haven’t… 
Woman: No!
Maston-Dar: Try again. The Destroyer, where is she?
Coulson: They’re killing people, innocent people.
Flint: In their hunt for me.
Mack: We’re not gonna let anything happen to you.
Elena: That’s right. We need to make a move on those blue bloods.
Coulson: Not with Daisy and Simmons still captive. We need to get out of the Lighthouse.
Flint: Tess…
Elena: So instead of rescue them, we abandon them?
Coulson: We don’t have a choice right now. They would do the same thing.
Mack: I agree. We regroup and come back for them more prepared.
Flint: Where’s Tess?
Elena: Where can we even go? Not a lot of hiding places in space.
Coulson: To the point at the end of this giant question mark, the surface.
Flint: Where is Tess?! Did something happen? Is she…?
Mack: I’m sorry.
Mack: It’s okay. I got this.
Kasius: You were always more interested in the power behind a weapon. The ability to kill.
Faulnak: The craftsmanship was what caught my eye. Once again, misplaced priorities.
Kasius: These particular tools from Earth seem a nice cross-section of our areas of interest.
Faulnak: Firearms are fine for those who need the safety of distance. I prefer a blade. Feel the warm blood on my hands as the life drains from my adversary’s body.
Kasius: Spoken like a true child of our father.
Faulnak: Maybe if you’d bothered to sound more like him, you would be less of a disgrace!
Kasius: A disgrace, who, with no prior training, was placed in charge of his own fleet. A disgrace who fought as you did against our enemies.
Faulnak: You lost a strategic outpost and thousands of warriors’ lives in the process.
Kasius: I was put in an impossible situation.
Faulnak: Excuses.
Kasius: I was cornered, outmanned, and overrun. Two of my trusted generals dead at my feet, enemies closing in.
Faulnak: And so you ran.
Kasius: What option did I have?
Faulnak: Glory! Drink the Odium. Fight and die like any of the Kasius family name would have rather than fleeing with your low-born subordinate. I wondered, is it her beauty that you admire or her ability to kill?
Kasius: Sinara defended me. She cut down my would-be attackers…
Faulnak: And you were both exiled for abandoning your posts!
Kasius: She saved my life! She’s been by my side ever since. You call me weak. My strength comes from surrounding myself with loyalty.
Faulnak: More platitudes. The only thing that runs deeper than the river of blood from your fallen soldiers is the shame you bring on our family. You’re like this planet, brother, once full of promise and father’s hopes to be molded into something magnificent. And now, just a broken speck of dust confined to the darkest edge of the galaxy. I’m eager for my man to find the Destroyer, so I can take leave of both.
Daisy: Aah. These pipes are hot. Wonder if that means this is the spa floor.
Simmons: Ah, a spa sounds great. I’d kill for a hot shower and a comfy bed. This one’s cold.
Daisy: There’s a lot of power running into here.
Fitz: Tracking signs of airborne contaminants, mold, harmful chemicals, carbon monoxide.
Simmons: An air-filtration system.
Fitz: This must be the hub for life-support systems.
Simmons: Well, of course there’d be one. This station is essentially a giant vivarium for humans.
Fitz: Well, I think I know how they’re creating the artificial gravity for the station.
Simmons: That can’t be.
Daisy: What is it?
Simmons: Unless I’m mistaken, and I hope I am, that’s…
Fitz: Gravitonium.
Simmons: Fitz!
Maston-Dar: Submit willingly or entertain me. These are your options.
Daisy: Get back!
Simmons: Okay. Okay. Sit down. Okay. Careful.
Deke: Good thing I’m wearing a helmet.
Daisy: You. You come to collect the bounty?
Deke: No, I came to save your ass.
Daisy: I should kill you right now.
Fitz: Who the hell is this guy?
Daisy: He works for Kasius.
Deke: I don’t work for… I mean, sometimes I do, technically, but right now, I’m Team S.H.I.E.L.D., all right?
Daisy: Well, it’s convenient, you showing up right now.
Deke: Convenient? No, it’s mind-blowing I managed to escape my room after Coulson welded the door shut. I had to crack a window. A lot of my personal valuables are now floating around space, thanks very much, everybody.
Daisy: What? This story’s supposed to make me feel better, that Coulson locked you up?
Deke: We were working out our differences, all right? I don’t have time to get into this.
Fitz: Can we discuss this after we’re out of the line of fire?
Deke: Yes, thank you, this guy. Now please follow me. We go up the service shafts. It’ll lead us right onto the trawler.
Daisy: No, no, no, no. This is the guy that sold me to Kasius.
Simmons: Oh. Kill him. He’s a snake.
Fitz: I’m gonna cut his throat open. Aah.
Deke: I’m a pragmatist, all right? Just lis… just listen. I told you that I would lead you to your friend. There she is. And I stopped you from doing something drastic that would have gotten people killed in the process. Thought you don’t look great.
Fitz: Thank you.
Simmons: And now you just happen to stumble upon us?
Deke: All the channels are buzzing with the news of your escape. I just had to follow the dead bodies. It led me right to you. We are out of time!
Daisy: How do we know you’re not gonna lead us into another trap?
Deke: You don’t.
Mack: Hey. Look, I know Tess…
Flint: You didn’t know Tess.
Mack: You’re right.
Flint: You don’t know nothing about me, either.
Mack: Well, you’re not the first person to tell me that. I’m not here to tell you anything you don’t already know. I’m just… Well, I’m just here. If you need me.
Flint: It’s not fair.
Mack: Yeah. Well, it never is. I lost people, too, it doesn’t ever get easier.
Flint: Thought you weren’t gonna tell me something I didn’t already know. Maybe I should just turn myself in, stop more people from dying.
Mack: No. You have a gift now. You can help people, protect them.
Flint: “Protect them.” I couldn’t protect Tess. Couldn’t protect my parents. What happens if I can’t protect you, either?
Mack: Stay put. I got you.
Daisy: I thought they’d be here.
Coulson: Daisy? How did you escape?
Daisy: Clumsily. Hey.
Coulson: Fitz!
Mack: Turbo! Man, it’s good to see you! How the hell you get in the future?
Fitz: Uh, the long way.
Simmons: He needs medical attention. Story time can wait.
Mack: Well, not when those stories include time travel. This guy? The hell you doing here? And how’d you get out of your cage?
Deke: Well, I let myself out, but thanks very much for your concern.
Elena: Well, the gang’s all here except May.
Coulson: Except May. She was taken to the surface?
Fitz: Yeah.
Coulson: That’s a good thing.
Daisy: Is it?
Simmons: We need alcohol for his wound.
Mack: I’ll see if Flint can find something. Get out of here. Flint, can… Oh, no.
Vicar: You. You know the whereabouts of the escaped Inhuman?
Flint: Yeah. I do. Too many people have died. Good people.
Vicar: You were offered the highest honor a human could hope for, to join Kasius below and see others rewarded in kind. Now they’ll get nothing. But good you turned yourself in.
Flint: I won’t let any more innocent lives be lost. Not for me.
Vicar: Unh!
Flint: That was for Tess.
Kree: I’ll alert command.
Sinara: No.
Kree: But he’s an Inhuman.
Sinara: He’s bait.
Daisy: What are his powers again?
Mack: He can move rocks with his mind.
Daisy: How is he in a fight?
Coulson: Undisciplined, but I’m guessing not incompetent.
Mack: He’s in over his head on this one, though. We all might be, but it never stopped us before.
Coulson: They don’t know I have this.
Daisy: Don’t hurt the kid. I’m the one you want.
Sinara: On your knees.
Daisy: Just take me. Let him go.
Sinara: I’ll take you both.
Daisy: Rocks, huh? That’s cool. Come on.
Mack: Let’s go, let’s go!
Maston-Dar: Scrappy. Let’s put an end to this.
Daisy: Are you okay?
Flint: Yeah.
Mack: Everyone here?
Coulson: Yeah. We’re all accounted for.
Fitz: Well, most of me, anyway.
Daisy: Mr. and Mrs. Boba Fett will be here any minute.
Simmons: So, what do we do now?
Coulson: We escape via the trawler.
Deke: Escape to where?
Coulson: The surface. All signs have been pointing us there. The Kree won’t follow us there, and you don’t have to follow us there, either.
Deke: Hey, man, I already told you that I’m in, to go out with you.
Elena: No one’s getting out of here if they catch us first.
Flint: Less arguing, more figuring out what the hell we’re gonna do.
Coulson: That ought to by us some time. Or not.
Mack: I thought I told you not to go out there.
Flint: You told me to use my powers to protect people.
Mack: This isn’t your problem to fix.
Flint: It is my problem! They’re after me!
Daisy: And me.
Simmons: And me.
Elena: I don’t think they’re gonna be picky about who they kill.
Daisy: Well, we can’t leave with this place surrounded.
Coulson: Come on. A room full of secret agents, scientists, and superheroes. Someone give me something.
Elena: We stand our ground and fight.
Fitz: Yeah, with what? Rocks and rubbish?
Flint: I can fight with rocks.
Elena: How else do you propose to get out of here?
Deke: We don’t go out. We go up.
Coulson: There’s no elevators here.
Deke: Then we make our own elevator with this.
Fitz: A belt buckle?
Simmons: It’s an anti-gravity device.
Deke: This chute leads directly to the drop bay under the trawler. We can get to the airlock from there.
Simmons: We use the device to create a gravity well.
Mack: Will it work?
Deke: Yeah, it’ll work.
Coulson: It’s our best option at this point.
Deke: I’ll go first. I’ll show you how it works. And then I’ll drop the puck down, the next person can come up.
Daisy, Coulson, Fitz, Simmons, May, Mack, Elena: No. No, no, no.
Daisy: Not a chance. I’m not gonna let you use us as bait while you make your grand escape. Fitz-Simmons, you’re up. You’re last.
Sinara: You’re slow.
Fitz: Once more unto the breach.
Simmons: Allons-y.
Coulson: All right, Yo-Yo, you’re up next. Let’s keep it moving.
Maston-Dar: Stand back. I’ll handle them.
Deke: I’m the last one. You satisfied?
Simmons: You sure they can’t follow us?
Deke: No, they can definitely follow us. It’s gonna take them a while.
Coulson: All right. So you ready to take this thing out?
Deke: What, me? I’m not a pilot.
Daisy: What? You don’t know how to fly this thing?
Deke: Never said I did.
Coulson: Okay. What about you, Flint? Wasn’t Virgil giving you flying lessons?
Flint: Well, yeah. And I’m not bad, but, uh… I’m not leaving with you guys.
Mack: What do you mean you’re not leaving with us? You have to. This whole station will kill you on sight.
Flint: Look, you told me to use my powers to protect people, right? They’re in this mess because of me. I can’t just abandon them. I’m gonna figure out a way to get them out of it.
Mack: Okay. Well, I guess we’re gonna have to come up with a plan, then, don’t we?
Flint: “We?”
Mack: Yeah, we. Remember what I told you? I’m here if you need me. I got you.
Elena: Me too.
Coulson: Wait. Mack. what about never splitting up?
Mack: Yeah, I know, sir, but I’m not leaving him behind. Look. We’ll handle things here. You get to the surface and figure out what the hell all this is about.
Coulson: Be safe.
Mack: I’ll see you soon.
Fitz: Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, if you guys really are gonna go fight a bunch of alien warriors, then you might be interested to know that, in the past, I hid a crate of S.H.I.E.L.D. tech in a wall on the base.
Mack: Oh, that’s what I’m talking about. Thanks, Turbo.
Elena: Where?
Fitz: Level three.
Mack: You got to be kidding me.
Elena: You mean the level infested with aliens that suck your blood?
Fitz: Well, how was I su… I feel like I’m not getting enough credit here. I have traveled through time and space to find you. I think we’re moving past that bit a little bit too quickly.
Mack: Turbo, Turbo, Turbo. We wouldn’t expect anything less. Thank you.
Fitz: Good luck.
Coulson: So, taking off is easy enough, docking is the hard part, and landing, that’s impossible on account of these ships weren’t built with landing gear.
Daisy: So, you have no idea what you’re doing.
Coulson: I got a flying car. How different can it be? Hold on.
Faulnak: How troublesome it is searching for rats in a sewer. So many places to scurry away and hide.
Kasius: Sinara. What news do you bring?
Faulnak: Out with it, girl.
Sinara: They have escaped.
Kasius: Escaped?
Faulnak: To where?
Sinara: Friends. On the surface.
Kasius: Impossible.
Faulnak: So, the Destroyer of Worlds has escaped, willingly makes for your land of exile, where apparently, others have survived. Your incompetence is almost admirably astounding.
Kasius: There must be some…
Faulnak: Ready a ship for Maston-Dar. If humans can survive the perils of this planet, it will be just fine for him to pursue.
Sinara: Maston is dead.
Faulnak: By whose hand?
Sinara: My own.
Faulnak: Sinara. Holding your own against the Destroyer of Worlds, felling my own best warrior. It seems I underestimated you and your desire to climb higher in the ranks, within which I now have an opening. My brother confines you to his dungeon, denying you the right to shine. On my side, you will shine more radiant than the stars we will conquer. A warrior such as yourself deserves a leader worthy of your talents. I will show you things Kasius could never.
Kasius: Sinara is not some object to be taken. The truth, brother? We both know father sent me on a suicide mission. Two of my generals were dead at my feet, yes, because Sinara killed them. They were preventing me from fleeing the battlefield. You see, Sinara said, and I agree, that the battlefield is not my place. I’m not built for it. With the bloodshed left to her, I can focus on greater things, and have. I wasted so much time on my knees, seeking your approval. No more.
Faulnak: You play god over a dead rock. But you’re just a coward who hides, then stabs his enemies in the back.
Kasius: And in the front. A life spent. A life earned. Think how warmly father will greet us when we avenge my brother’s death and bring him the Destroyer of Worlds. Everything we’ve ever wanted will soon come to bear.
Fitz: I’m never leaving your side again.
Simmons: Yeah, I feel the same way. That’s why I asked you to marry me.
Fitz: I a… Mm. Doesn’t matter.
Simmons: I don’t know about you, but I could really use a drink right about now.
Fitz: I’m just happy for some alone time.
Coulson: Okay! So not exactly like a flying car!
Deke: We are so stupid!
Daisy: So much for smooth sailing.
Coulson: Hang on!
Enoch: Welcome back, Agent May. You hit your head quite hard.
May: Where are we? The Zephyr. How? What is going on?
Enoch: They grabbed us just in time. Anchored us against the gravity storm.
May: Who?
Robin: I have waited such a long time to see you again.
