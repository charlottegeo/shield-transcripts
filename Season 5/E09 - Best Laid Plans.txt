Mack: Hold your fire! Nice work.
Gunner: Yeah? Why does the guy named Gunner get stuck throwing rocks?
Mack: ‘Cause you’re damn good at it.
Elena: Enemy of my enemy.
Mack: Yeah, puts things in perspective. He’s fighting for a good reason.
Elena: For the record, I like Rebel Peacemaker Mack, too. He’s sexy.
Mack: Is that right?
Flint: Whoa. Two more Kreepers. This is our floor now. No Blues allowed.
Mack: Hey, slow down, slow down. We got a long way to go still.
Elena: Smile, Turtle Man. We did good.
Mack: We got lucky. But now Kasius knows we’re still here. They’ll be back.
Kasius: The humans are alive? Impossible.
Kree: They killed the Vrellnexians. And we lost eight soldiers.
Kasius: How can that be?
Kree: The humans have guns.
Kasius: Where on this cursed rock did they find weapons?! If even one item doesn’t make it onto my ship whole, then I fear neither will you! Am I clear? An uprising. Just as I’m on the verge of leaving this place, Destroyer in hand. No matter. Have the doctor awaken our latest acquisition. It’s time to remind the humans I am not their enemy. I am their God.
Enoch: This Inhuman boy, Flint, you say his geokinesis is the key to building a new monolith, to your returning home?
Coulson: Technically, Robin said it to May, but yeah, that’s the idea.
Enoch: And how exactly will that work?
Coulson: We have a monolith shard that Simmons said has a unique crystalline structure that he can… It’s a rock. Flint controls rocks. I don’t know. Won’t matter if we can’t make it back to the Lighthouse.
Enoch: Then we must hope he remains safe while we wait out the intensifying gravity storm. By my calculations…
Coulson: It’ll last for weeks, and we need to evacuate. Right, you’ve been saying that. Kind of on repeat. Whatever you’re doing, do it faster. How we lookin’?
Fitz: Terrible. Zephyr One’s been a crash site for going on 80 years, so it’s a mess.
Daisy: It’s gonna be a while till comms are up and running. ‘Cause I’m pretty sure generations of space rats have lived and died in here.
Simmons: Not to ruin the mood, but avionics are online.
Enoch: Agent Coulson, we are evacuating to the caves for shelter, are we not?
May: Zephyr flies again, metal man.
Enoch: I am mostly plastic alloy. And Chronicoms do not have gender.
Coulson: We don’t have weeks. We’re gonna outrun the storm. Pull the ground anchors, fly past as many roaches as we can, and land at the Lighthouse.
Enoch: You are confident, despite knowing this will surely end in your deaths.
Daisy: We’re not gonna bury our heads in the sand while our friends are in danger.
Fitz: Well, so much for avionics.
Simmons: Rerouting must have overloaded the MPDU.
Fitz: Need to try and bypass the subsystems.
May: Hey, Plastic, make yourself useful. Secure this in the back.
Enoch: Plastics are quite useful, if not often appreciated.
Coulson: I’m sorry she had to go like that. You want to talk about it?
May: I, um, don’t know where to start.
Coulson: An old woman tells you that she was your daughter and that you’ll save the planet from cracking apart, doesn’t happen every day.
May: It’s hard to believe.
Coulson: That we can do it?
May: That I was a mom. I just… I can’t see it.
Coulson: I can.
Daisy: Yeah. You’d be that no phone, no TV, 7:30 curfew kind of mom. You’re kind of proving my point with the face.
Coulson: For Robin’s sake, we need to make sure this world never comes to be.
Daisy: Yeah. No matter what.
May: What are we gonna do with Voss?
Coulson: I left that up to Deke.
Voss: You’re upset. I don’t blame you. Think about what you’re doing here.
Deke: You killed him.
Voss: Me and Owen were lockstep in almost everything. Always agreed to pull these people out of the past, but once they got here, we never saw eyetoeye on that. He thought they’d come with some grand solution. I thought killing them was the solution. You know how stubborn your old man could be.
Deke: You were his best friend.
Voss: Yeah. Up until the day he tried to end that argument for good. Came at me with a knife, and the knife ended up in his throat. You know he was capable of it. Not how I wanted it to go down, but I did what I had to do.
Deke: It was all for nothing. You haven’t done a damn thing.
Voss: We survived a decade in this hellscape! You have no idea what we went through, what we sacrificed for this. And now the people responsible are upstairs. We could finish it, but you want to kill me? You’re no killer. It’s fine. Like your dad used to say, play the long game. Kasius thinks Quake is his ticket out of here. Let him have her. What’s the worst that could happen? She goes back in time, you already know what will happen.
Elena: Breathe, relax, aim, slack, squeeze.
Mack: What’s going on?
Flint: Check it out, big man. YoYo’s teaching me how to shoot.
Elena: One step at a time, hot shot.
Flint: Hey! Come on. You said yourself the Blues are gonna come back.
Mack: And when they do, we’ll fight them. Not you.
Flint: Look, you’ve seen what I can do. All right? I can help.
Mack: We’ll deal with it. End of discussion.
Flint: Whatever, man.
Elena: You know he can handle himself. He’s killed before.
Mack: Yeah. But now he’s developing a taste for it.
Elena: As long as he kills the bad guys.
Mack: He’s not a soldier, Yo-Yo. None of these people are.
Elena: We can teach them. We took this floor.
Mack: And there are dozens more full of people who have no idea how to fight for one another. We need a plan, not a mob.
Gunner: Mack, Kasius sent a messenger.
Elena: Hey. Come on.
Mack: All right, everyone, back up! Make room.
Elena: Santo infierno.
Flint: No way. Tess? I thought you were dead.
Tess: I was.
Tess: I fought. And I begged. They dragged me to the Exchange. Knives are cold.
Mack: It’s okay, Tess. You’re safe.
Tess: But I don’t feel the same.
Mack: Well, you’ve been put through a lot.
Tess: I was dead. And then screaming, my heart on fire. Kasius was there, smiling.
Flint: Is he magic?
Elena: S.H.I.E.L.D. dealt with something like this before.
Mack: In our time, we’ve seen Kree biology bring people back.
Flint: How is that possible?
Tess: Kasius said he’d “smothered the fires of death with the blood of the eternal.” That’s how he talks. It’s horrible.
Elena: I’m so sorry, Tess. It was me who took Flint from the ceremony.
Tess: If I could do what you do, I would’ve done the same.
Flint: Look, I say we get in that elevator, we go down there, and we kill them all.
Mack: Pump the brakes, Pebbles. We’ve been over this.
Flint: I have powers. You let me loose on this guy…
Mack: Absolutely not!
Elena: He’s right. We take out Kasius, this is over. He’s just a man.
Tess: No. Kasius is a god. That’s why I’m standing here, as proof.
Mack: There’s only one God, and he for damn sure ain’t it.
Elena: So send me in.
Mack: Just calm down, Yo-Yo.
Elena: I’ll kill the blue bastard before he even knows what hit him.
Mack: And if he comes back to life, then what?
Elena: I’ll kill him again! It wouldn’t be the strangest thing I’ve done.
Tess: No, you don’t get it! If I don’t bring him everything he wants, he said he’d end the human race with the push of a button.
Flint: What does he want?
Tess: You. Everything he needs to keep breeding Inhumans, every child older than 10, and motivation for the Destroyer.
Elena: The Destroyer?
Tess: Of Worlds. Your friend Daisy. He’s working to get her back.
Mack: Motivation? You mean us?
Tess: Or we all burn.
Daisy: Everything okay, boss?
Coulson: Hand needs a little juice.
Daisy: Okay. Well, the comms are up and running. If we can get a line of sight to the Lighthouse, we should be able to contact Mack and… The sooner the better.
Coulson: Once we’re in, first thing we do is get downstairs, remove your inhibitor, get your powers back.
Daisy: Yeah. Maybe we don’t.
Coulson: I need you at full strength.
Daisy: You have me as an agent.
Coulson: Daisy…
Daisy: You saw the video. I was there at the end of everything. Can we really take that chance?
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D. needs Quake.
Daisy: I’m just tired of these names. If I’m… If I’m not Quake, I can’t be the Destroyer of Worlds. Maybe I should just be Daisy Johnson, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson: Okay, Phil. Back to work.
Fitz: Aah! Damn it.
Simmons: Fitz, please be careful.
Fitz: Well, I’m not trying to electrocute myself. But everything has been reconfigured, so I don’t even know what I’m looking at.
Simmons: Wait, I think I do.
Fitz: That’s my design.
Simmons: Yeah, for the next-gen Zephyr. I remember.
Fitz: Complete with RCS thrusters. But that was purely theoretical. It’s useless without… artificial gravity.
Simmons: Oh.
Fitz: Had to be Gravitonium.
Simmons: Fitz, it’s on the base. It’s here on the plane. It’s everywhere.
Fitz: Flying in with Enoch, I was trying to figure out how it was all possible. A planet this shape with atmosphere. Gravitonium would explain why it’s held together.
Simmons: And maybe why it was cracked apart.
Fitz: But it being here also means that… It’s true. Robin, May… it’s all true. This is the same design from the Lighthouse, so unless someone else just happened to come up with the exact same idea. We did this. In the past. After we’ve lived this moment.
Simmons: Yeah, the causal loop paradox. We’d only know how to design it because we’d already seen it.
Fitz: Well, we’re done for. This is proof.
Simmons: I don’t know if that’s true.
Fitz: Yes, it is. Think about it. There is nothing that we do that matters. This is a bloody time loop. We’re doomed to fail.
Simmons: If we did this, do you know what I see? Proof we make it back.
Daisy: I think that was a hospital.
Enoch: Is this your first time having a building dropped on you?
May: No.
Coulson: Uh, okay.
Daisy: Yes, that’s what I’m talking about.
Coulson: You were gone a long time. Is Voss still among us?
Deke: He knows stuff we don’t. I thought we might still need him.
May: Ha! Yes!
Coulson: Are the engines good to go?
Simmons: In theory, but, sir, we found something.
Fitz: Zephyr One’s been upgraded significantly.
Coulson: Will those upgrades help us take off?
Fitz: Uh, well, no…
Coulson: ‘Cause it’s time to fly. May!
May: Okay. Once we have ignition, be ready to lift the ground anchors. Here we go.
Fitz: Oh. Come on.
Coulson: Talk to me, Fitz.
Fitz: Well, the engines just blew out, so we can’t take off.
Enoch: As was previously advised, we should now evacuate to the caves. I’ll go first.
Tess: Look, we need to go to Kasius now. We’re out of time.
Mack: No one’s going anywhere until we know exactly what we’re up against.
Elena: I’ll go. He wants me. Hand me over.
Mack: You always do. This is always the same argument.
Elena: Zip-zip, I chop his head off, done!
Flint: Yeah, count me in.
Mack: You’ll get yourselves killed.
Tess: If we don’t go, he’ll make every one of us a vacancy.
Mack: With the push of a button, right? So how’s he gonna do that? Best guess, he’d have a trigger installed to remotely cut our oxygen.
Elena: Another reason to deal with him quickly.
Mack: Humor me.
Flint: I don’t see nothing.
Tess: Please, I hate this, too, but we need to give Kasius what he wants.
Elena: Maybe he’s bluffing.
Tess: He’s wiped out floors before. His exact words were, “They’ll all burn.”
Mack: “They’ll all burn.”
Flint: Is that a bomb?
Mack: Hardwired directly to the O2 lines for this floor. That’s pure oxygen.
Elena: If there’s one on every line and on every human floor, there’s got to be hundreds.
Flint: Kasius could kill us in a flash.
Mack: Not just kill. Incinerate.
Deke: All right. Time’s up. Move out.
Man: Let’s go.
Daisy: Finally starting to get a hang of this whole goodguy thing.
Deke: Yeah, just in time for the sky to fall and kill us all. Good timing, Deke. What makes you say that?
Daisy: Voss. You let him live.
Deke: Doesn’t mean I’m good. Maybe I’m just spineless.
Daisy: Killing is never the better option.
Deke: If it can prevent more pain, maybe. I’m sure you’ve done it. My dad could be very violent, but only when he needed to be. You learn that in the Lighthouse. A life spent, a life earned.
Daisy: Never a life saved?
Deke: That’s my point. Shouldn’t I be able to pull the trigger if I think that person could do more harm?
Daisy: I don’t think Voss is a threat to anyone but me.
Deke: Right. No, you’re right.
Deke: Get as far into the caves as possible. We’re right behind you.
Voss: You here to waste me for good?
Coulson: That’s not how I roll. But don’t push your luck. You’re going into the caves. Turn around.
Voss: That’s why you fail. 'Cause you’re not willing to do what has to be done.
Coulson: Clearly, you haven’t read my file. We’re not in the habit of killing unarmed people.
Voss: You think that was easy? She was a friend. You seem to be just fine with the continents you’ll let die.
Coulson: What makes you certain that we cause it?
Voss: History. There was a light from the sky. Aliens is what I heard. S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to stop it and failed. Brought Hell to Earth.
Coulson: As cryptic prophecies go, you’d give Robin a run for her money.
Voss: That was from her. She said that was the start, and then your girl finished it. Sadly, you’ll see for yourself.
Deke: We need to go!
Voss: You waiting to get Daisy alone?
Deke: Shut your trap. I’m not gonna do anything to anyone except maybe you.
Voss: You keep telling yourself that, but you’re not like them. You’ll do what’s right.
Coulson: Now’s the time, Deke. You should go, too.
Deke: No, I’ve come this far. I need to see it through.
Mack: It’s an impossible choice. As leaders of your floors, we need you with us. This took me all of an hour to disconnect, but it can’t be disabled and it’s triggered remotely. Kasius’ demands must be met.
Gunner: Wait, you want us to hand our kids over to that lunatic? Hell, no!
Elena: Even if we were crazy enough to do that, we can’t trust Kasius to hold his end of the bargain.
Gunner: Then we fight! Take him out!
Mack: Suicide. He’ll burn us all.
Gunner: We’ll fight!
Mack: Listen! Yo-Yo and I are turning ourselves over to him.
Gunner: Kasius will kill you.
Elena: Maybe. Or maybe we get close enough to take him out of the picture.
Mack: There’s no other way. Now, you won’t see us again. But if we succeed, your children will be safe.
Elena: The most important thing is that you keep your heads down and keep working.
Tess: Kasius is insane. If they fail, he’ll invent new ways to punish us, to make us suffer.
Flint: Don’t go back. I could sneak you on another floor, keep you safe.
Tess: Flint, there’s nowhere to run.
Flint: I can’t lose you again, Tess. I don’t have anyone else.
Tess: I think you do.
Flint: Look, let me go with you. Let me fight.
Mack: There are other ways to fight. Remember what we said.
Elena: These people need you now.
Daisy: Z-One can’t take much more of this!
Simmons: Let’s just hope it’s here at all after the storm.
Enoch: The sensation of death is one that I have yet to experience.
May: Maybe I can help you with that!
Coulson: Almost everyone else is gone. Let’s move!
Simmons: Cut the anchors.
Deke: Did she hit her head?
Simmons: Cut the ground anchors! Let a gravity wave take us. That’s how we get in the air.
May: We can’t fly without engines!
Simmons: Maybe we don’t have to.
Coulson: Simmons!
Simmons: The upgrades. Zephyr One has Reaction Control System thrusters, meaning capable of maneuvering in space.
Fitz: If we could get high enough, we could break through Earth’s diminished gravity. We could fly in space straight to the Lighthouse.
Simmons: Yeah.
Deke: No, right?! That’s a bad idea, right?! Could that actually work?
Fitz: Assuming we don’t get crushed by debris.
Simmons: Slammed back to the ground.
Fitz: Our thrusters don’t run out of power.
Simmons: And spin out into the void. We’re in!
Daisy: Same.
Deke: I used to be really good at selfpreservation!
Coulson: May, can you pilot us through a gravity storm?
Daisy: Another mom face.
Coulson: You can do this. We can do this.
Simmons: Yeah, okay:
Doyle: When did you get so soft, Fletcher? Put your back into it! We got to go! Hey! You’re going the wrong way. We got to get underground. All right. You’re on your own.
Kree: Your messenger has returned.
Kasius: Wonderful. Send them in. Alone? It appears I did not properly detail the consequences of your failure.
Tess: I’m sorry. I told them what you said, but they wouldn’t come.
Kasius: Perhaps you should burn along with the rest of your kind, coming to me empty-handed.
Tess: I’m alone but not empty-handed.
Kasius: Where did you get those?
Tess: I gave them your message. They insisted on sending one back. They’re holding your research floor until you come and meet them.
Kasius: Meet them? I will send a battalion to grind their bones to dust.
Tess: But that’s the thing. If you don’t go and face them, they’ll burn your ability to breed another Inhuman. With “the push of a button.” That’s how they wanted me to say it.
Kasius: Bring her.
Daisy: Coulson!
Deke: Whoa. Yikes. That is definitely gonna get infected.
Daisy: Are you okay?
Coulson: I’ve been worse, but I’ve been better, too.
Enoch: As the gravitational forces accelerate, our chances of implosion are rapidly increased.
May: Tell me your primary function again?
Enoch: To observe and record the evolution of your species.
May: More observing, less sharing.
Fitz: Thrusters and artificial gravity are ready! We’ll have about 10 minutes of power to both!
Simmons: Don’t fire the thrusters until we’re at the very edge of the atmosphere or we will certainly die!
May: Great! Everybody buckle in! No! The anchors won’t release.
Coulson: What?
May: The anchors are stuck. We can’t lift off.
Daisy: I’m on it!
Elena: Don’t look at me like that. We agreed to do this.
Mack: Yeah, as long as we keep our heads.
Elena: We won’t be the ones losing heads.
Mack: Look, there’s no way to know how Kasius activates his explosives, so until we see the controls…
Elena: “Don’t do anything rash, stay calm, and don’t kill anyone, Yo-Yo.” Yes, I remember your many stern warnings.
Mack: Okay. 'Cause we both know you don’t exactly do well around people like this.
Elena: Evil men who kidnap and torment defenseless women and children? No, I don’t.
Mack: Yeah. I hope Flint’s all right. We put a lot on him today.
Elena: The people like him. If anyone can keep them together, it’s him.
Mack: He’s a kid.
Elena: Well, I wasn’t much older when I started out. He’ll be fine. You know I’m right.
Mack: Please.
Elena: No promises.
Mack: I got to say, that… that’s not what I pictured.
Kasius: Yo-Yo Rodriguez? How peculiar.
Elena: Says the space mime.
Mack: Nobody moves!
Kasius: You think you’re invincible. But in the end, you will submit.
Mack: Give us the controls to your explosives upstairs, or your Inhumanmaking days are over.
Kasius: Throw yourself at my feet, and I will consider bringing you back after having you slaughtered.
Mack: Yo-Yo…
Elena: We’re not scared of you. You hide behind stronger men and force them to do your bidding. You’re a coward.
Kasius: It’s ironic, really. You would trade Inhumans for Humans when that very deal was brokered ages ago. In all my time here, the one defining trait of your kind, you will always turn on one another.
Daisy: Turn, damn it! Come on.
Sinara: Kasius misses you.
Fitz: May! Hit the gravity!
Deke: Aah!
Enoch: If I had a stomach, the vomiting would begin now.
Coulson: Thrusters?! Talk to me, Fitz!
Simmons: Ah!
Fitz: We’re not high enough yet!
Simmons: This was a terrible idea! I’m sorry!
Elena: You love forcing our choices, so how does it feel to be on the other side, for once?
Kasius: Any moment now, Sinara will secure the Destroyer, and you will have no choice but to surrender.
Kasius: Stand down or experience death like your friend, many, many times.
Mack: You’re a real piece of work, you know that?
Kasius: I am a god to be feared. Humans beg to be ruled. Without me, they’d have perished long ago.
Mack: I guess you’re not a New Testament guy. Vengeance and torment are tools of the Devil.
Elena: And of the weak.
Kasius: You want a devil? I’ll show you a Hell you cannot imagine.
Elena: You’re no god, no devil! You’re just a cruel, sad, little blue man. So why don’t we skip to the part where I end this?
Sinara: I’m not supposed to kill you. But oh, well.
Deke: I knew I was going to regret this.
Kasius: Elena, spare the theatrics. You wouldn’t dare such a brazen attempt, not with the lives of your precious humans dangling between us and the void.
Flint: You really do talk funny.
Mack: Is it done?
Flint: Do I get to fight now?
Kasius: Now that we’re all here, is this what you were waiting for? Surrender or make your play. Either way, you will be mine!
Elena: I choose play.
Kasius: You didn’t think I’d be ready for that? I promised suffering. Now I make good on that promise.
Deke: Okay! Okay! That is quite the jaw you got there. Consider me impressed. Oh!
May: Now?
Fitz: Now!
Enoch: A sound plan, indeed.
Mack: I’ll do it.
Kasius: You’ll set me back, but you won’t stop me. You forced my hand. Remember, you did this!
Gunner: Let’s go! That’s all of them. Let’s go! Let’s get upstairs!
Mack: Tess said you were a slow talker, so we kind of leaned into that.
Kasius: You were stalling.
Mack: Took some time to move all the explosives down to level 25.
Kasius: And you moved the people up.
Elena: They all worked together, every human floor.
Flint: And now they’re out of your reach. Cut off, you Kreeper.
Tess: They’re free.
Kasius: But not you! For all of you, it’s now over!
Mack: Over? No, no, no, no. Asskicking’s just begun.
Kasius: Nooo!
Daisy: Mack, Yo-Yo, do you copy? Mack, Yo-Yo, do you copy?
Deke: Really? It’s like a family heirloom.
Simmons: That we need in two places at once.
Daisy: Alphonso Mackenzie, do you copy? Mack, can you hear me? Mack?
Mack: Tremors, thank God. You all still in one piece?
Daisy: More or less. It’s good to hear your voice.
Coulson: Mack, we’re on our way to you. Do you have Flint?
Mack: Yes, we do. You got a plan?
Kree: We spotted something that…
Kasius: Let me guess. The Destroyer and her friends are heading here in an old S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft.
Kree: Yes, but how do you…
Kasius: They’re nearing the landing pad?
Kree: It appears so.
Kasius: Ready a squad. We will meet them there and finish this once and for all.
Kree: Kasius, apologies, but how did you know?
Kasius: They have a seer telling them what’s to come? Well, I have one of my own.
