May: Simmons give you the all clear? You got banged up pretty good.
Fitz: Yeah, no. I’m fine. I just… I feel foolish. I was so intent on turning the beacon off, I didn’t even consider that it might be wired to overheat and explode.
Coulson: You can’t blame yourself, Fitz. General Hale’s declared war on us.
Fitz: I’m afraid she’s done something a whole lot worse than that. The basement’s sealed off, but I sent the Dwarfs down to analyze the area after the explosion. This one was on its way down when the elevator stopped and opened on Level 27.
May: Looks like your drone took a wrong turn and went outside.
Fitz: Wouldn’t that be nice? Unfortunately, this immense forest now exists approximately 150 feet below us.
May: But there are clouds and… and sky.
Fitz: Which is why its underground existence should be very alarming.
Coulson: I’d say that’s impossible, but after our round trip to Tomorrowland, my threshold for preposterous is way out of whack. Theories?
Fitz: This is the only transmission received back from the basement so far. I think we’re looking at what happens when three monoliths are blown up together. They somehow blew a hole in space-time, and that thing… that thing right there is another dimension bleeding back into our world.
Coulson: So, the good news is Daisy might not be the one responsible for tearing the Earth apart.
Fitz: Bad news is end of the world may have already begun.
Simmons: Sorry. Is it too tight?
Elena: No.
Simmons: And the pain?
Elena: So-so now, but, sometimes, my fingers feel like they’re on fire.
Simmons: I’m so sorry. Daisy’s getting more supplies so we can make you comfortable.
Elena: Thank you, Jemma.
Simmons: I’ll give you some time.
Elena: You look scared, Turtleman.
Mack: Of course I am. The woman I love nearly died in front of me.
Elena: I’m not gonna die. Not yet.
Mack: That’s good to hear. I’m gonna do everything I can to help. I’m sorry. I just get so angry. To make it back from that fractured future only to watch you get… get butchered.
Elena: I’ll get through this as long as I have you.
Mack: You’re the only world I care about. You say the word, and I’ll carry you out of here and never look back.
Elena: Thank you for that but we have to stay and fight. The things I heard in the future, they’re all coming true, faster than imagined. We can’t leave.
Daisy: Okay, so, we need to find where they keep the medication. Something for nerve pain.
Deke: Whoa. “Orange scented.” That’s amazing. Oh, my!
Daisy: Okay, snack time’s over, Huckleberry. Simmons is waiting.
Deke: It’s nearly impossible to get fresh fruits and vegetables. But e-every year for my birthday, my mom would find me a big, juicy orange.
Daisy: Sounds like a nice tradition.
Deke: Yeah, it was. I loved the way my hands smelled after. What about you? Did you have any special birthday traditions growing up?
Daisy: Nope.
Deke: Seriously? Nothing? Were you just raised in a house by sucky parents?
Daisy: More like an orphanage with mean, scary nuns.
Deke: Oh, I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be a jerk.
Daisy: Really?
Deke: Well, I mean sometimes I do, because I think it’s funny, but not just then. I thought we were having a moment.
Daisy: Just to be clear, you and I have never had a moment. That was just you telling me a story about your very nice mom and an orange. Deke!
Fitz: It’s our fears come to life.
May: What the hell are you talking about, Fitz? What fear?
Fitz: I’m still trying to piece it all together. But here. Watch this. It’s low-res, but it’s all I could salvage from one of the dwarfs.
May: This can’t be.
Coulson: Fitz?
Fitz: I think that when the monoliths exploded, they tore open something that I can only describe as a fear dimension. And it’s leaking out. See these emissions here?
Coulson: What do you think that is?
Fitz: I don’t know, uh, alien energy. The Dwarf went offline before I could analyze it. But whatever it is, it seems that it can reach inside our minds.
Daisy: Yeah, well, it can do more than that. That Kree almost killed Deke.
Fitz: Yeah, and I don’t understand how, but it seems that this dimension can take our deepest fears and it can manifest them physically.
Daisy: So, Kree warrior. Check.
May: And if that is Lash, double check.
Coulson: What about that forest on Level 27?
Deke: You mean an overwhelming collection of branchy things with birds and bugs and the floor all covered in worms? Are you kidding? That’s… That’s a horror show.
Daisy: Okay, triple check.
Fitz: I’m gonna seal off the lower 2/3 of the Lighthouse. That’s where the bulk of the phenomena is occurring, but it’s flaring out. The fact that it’s reached Level 27 as well as the supply pantry tells me it’s getting worse.
May: So, how do we stop it?
Fitz: Okay. I have a potential fix, but I don’t know how to do it without one of us possibly sacrificing ourselves. Okay. Deke.
Deke: Oh, no. Me? No, no. Hell, no. No, I just got here. I just got to a world that’s got ice cream and the sun and orange-scented stuff. So, no. No, no, no. And in case any of you forgot, I already did the heroic sacrifice thing to get you all here. So, I-I’m… I’m done.
Fitz: I’m not asking you to sacrifice yourself. I just want to borrow your belt buckle.
Deke: Oh.
Fitz: It creates an applied gravity field. And I was hoping there was enough Gravitonium, with some modifications, to create a perpetual force that can stitch together the tear in space-time. Before it spreads, can I?
Deke: Well, anything to save the world, right?
Fitz: Sure. As I said, there is a catch. One of us is gonna have to carry this device down and activate it. And that person may get sucked into another dimension or killed by a manifestation of fear.
Coulson: That’s a risk I’ll have to take.
Fitz: Sorry, sir, but, no. There’s no way. If that rift could spread, then someone’s got to do it.
May: Not you. I’m sorry, but there’s only one candidate.
Fitz: Piper. She said a thousand times she’ll do anything for our forgiveness.
Coulson: Fitz, cool it. We keep her in holding for now.
Fitz: Okay, okay. Well, then, if not her, who?
May: We need engineering, and we need medical. Yo-Yo needs Mack. And without you, we’re flying blind.
Daisy: So that leaves me.
May: No, that’s not who I meant.
Coulson: We need you both. Stop it.
May: I’ll go. I’m a specialist.
Daisy: You’re forgetting that I’m not supposed to be in this timeline.
Fitz: I can rework the problem!
Coulson: None of you are expendable! I go in alone. End of discussion.
Daisy: Wait up. That’s stupid, and you know it. Military tactics 101. You never jeopardize a general when a soldier can do the job.
Coulson: You’re not just a soldier. Not anymore. Like it or not. You can’t throw yourself on the grenade.
Daisy: You’re doing that right now.
Coulson: You have to weigh consequences.
Daisy: Wait. No, hold on. That’s ex… You’re doing exactly what you’re telling me not to do right now. You’re putting yourself at risk, when my very existence here is dangerous.
Coulson: I’m looking at the big picture. You’re needed for the future, Daisy.
Daisy: The future? T-To lead? That’s what you said me when you ice’d me, right? “To lead.”
Coulson: And to inspire.
Daisy: To lead what? To inspire who?
Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D.
Daisy: There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson, there’s no S.H.I.E.L.D.! Look around!
Fitz: Okay, let’s just keep…
Daisy: No! No, no, no. May is never gonna be full strength, whether you’ll admit it or not. Mack is seconds away from quitting again because the love of his life, our only other strong fighter, was literally cut to pieces.
Coulson: Nobody quits.
May: Daisy.
Daisy: Piper stabbed us in the frickin’ backs. And Fitz-Simmons, my God, you really want to risk their lives again? They’ve been through enough! And guess what, Coulson, that’s it! That’s everybody!
Coulson: No, that’s not it! There’s an idea, a symbol that must continue, no matter what. A S.H.I.E.L.D. And I-I need you to… I need you to…
Daisy: Coulson.
May: Phil! Phil!
Fitz: Wait, wait. What happened?
May: Get Simmons. Now!
Daisy: Coulson.
Coulson: Are the instructions clear?
Deke: Yeah. I’m on it. Head up and outside, get some fresh air, and check things off the to-do list.
Coulson: You’re the only one who can do this. You don’t even exist, but if you keep getting arrested…
Deke: I know.
Coulson: Then that’s it. So be careful.
Deke: The rest of the team’s waiting in the control room. And I’m, um, sorry to hear…
Coulson: Just get the goods. I’ll be here when you get back.
Simmons: It’s not good. The MRI shows necrotic tissue branching out from the scarred areas surrounding Coulson’s life-threatening… life-ending injury to his heart and left lung. Which is why you lost your breath, sir.
Fitz: So it’s an… an infection?
Simmons: No, it isn’t caused by infection. It isn’t caused by anything I’ve ever seen. It’s tissue that appears to have been dead for several years.
Mack: What can we do? Can we cure this?
Simmons: The tissue is already dead. There is no cure for that. At least, not anymore. I can only surmise that it’s progressing at a rapid rate.
Fitz: So, what does that… what… what are you…
May: He’s dying. You’ve known since Ghost Rider, haven’t you?
Coulson: I didn’t know how to tell you and I didn’t think I should.
May: That’s the deal you made?
Coulson: Whatever alien voodoo was holding me together, Ghost Rider burned through it. That was the price.
Mack: So, what, he gets to burn longer?
Coulson: I don’t know, but my clock ticks faster, and we get to fight another day.
Daisy: How could you keep this from us?
Coulson: I’m sorry. I didn’t want you trying to find a solution when we had bigger problem.
Daisy: We had a solution. Tess was brought back from the dead. We had a solution right there.
Coulson: I didn’t want to go through all that again.
Daisy: So you just give up? You don’t get to do that. You make life-and-death decisions for us all the time, and we’re not allowed the same courtesy? After everything? We deserved to… We deserved to know.
Mack: How much more time does he have on his clock?
Simmons: Um, I won’t be able to tell until I can chart its progression, but even now, he’s at risk of various… At some point, sir, your heart will just stop beating.
Coulson: I’m gonna go check on Daisy.
May: You did this wrong, Phil. You put too much on her today. You should have told us.
Daisy: I… I can’t do what you’re asking of me. I can’t do it.
Coulson: You’ve always been capable of more than you imagined.
Daisy: No. Not without you. You found me, alone in an alley, and you… you gave me everything. A home, a-a belief, solid ground to stand on. But that was all you. You are what I believe in.
Coulson: You believe in yourself, and you should.
Daisy: No, if you want a symbol? You are the symbol. There’s no S.H.I.E.L.D. without you. ‭Th-There’s nothing without you. There’s…
Coulson: Come here.
Simmons: Bad dreams? The hydromorphone makes you drowsy, but the sleep can be restless.
Elena: Please don’t dope me up more. I need to stay clear-headed, to warn Mack.
Simmons: That the pain is just beginning? He knows. And you should spare him. He’s suffered enough. We’ve all suffered enough.
Elena: No! No! No! No!
Mack: No! What the hell?!
Simmons: The rift is expanding.
Mack: You okay?
Fitz: We can’t wait any longer. We have to try and seal it now. It’s getting way too dangerous in here.
Man: Seal off the main road!
Hale: We appreciate the call. This is the first time Ms. Johnson’s been sighted in months.
Wellins: I’m not positive it’s her, but one of my officers thought there was quite a resemblance.
Hale: Well, I’d like to see any security footage you might have on her. If S.H.I.E.L.D.’s in town, we’ll find them. So, what can you tell me about the man that Johnson bailed out, this, uh, Deke Shaw?
Wellins: Drunk and disorderly. Not much there there, if you know what I mean.
Deke: Hello?
Woman: You’ve reached your party’s extension. Fiona is not available. Please leave a…
Deke: Hello? Did this work? Can I talk to a person? Or can I talk to a real person? This system is ridiculous.
Wellins: He has no fingerprint matches, no passport or driver’s license. Hell, we couldn’t find any physical history at all.
Hale: I want to dust and examine the cell. You never know what might show up. He could lead us to Ms. Johnson.
May: You in pain?
Coulson: Not always.
May: Is this why we took a step back?
Coulson: The last thing you need is to waste your time on another lost cause.
May: Who I waste my time on is for me to decide. It’s not like you to just roll over. There has to be a way out of this.
Coulson: I’ve come to terms with it. I got a second chance. I made a difference in a few people’s lives. I don’t want to be greedy. It’s time to make space for somebody else.
May: For Daisy.
Coulson: I won’t be around forever, and despite appearances to the contrary, neither will you. We need fresh blood to lead the team.
May: It’s more than a team, and you know it. None of us are giving up on you.
Coulson: Well, great, because I have every intention of walking back out of that basement. Just because ‭I’ve made peace with dying doesn’t mean I’m in a hurry. Now, you want to help me get into this gear Fitz has for me? It’s super sexy.
Coulson: Okay. Take the elevator to the basement, find the rift, turn that puppy on, put it in the rift, then get the hell out of there.
Fitz: I wish it were that simple.
Coulson: You’re referring to the other things that might be down there, the things that I’m afraid of.
Fitz: Yeah. Along with everyone else’s fears. I wish there was another Chronicom. If Noah hadn’t been killed, I would have just sent him down there. His processor and advanced optics would protect him from a lot of the dimension’s effects.
Coulson: Is this to protect me from the dimension’s effects?
Fitz: Yeah. It’s a fifty caliber. Should take down anything you run into.
Coulson: Okay, then.
Fitz: Last thing. I’ve had to amplify the Gravitonium. So, when you turn it on, don’t get close to the rift. You could get crushed by its gravity field or sucked into the other dimension.
Coulson: Copy that. Don’t get too close.
Fitz: Anything else?
Coulson: Yeah. That other thing we talked about. I want you to promise me that you’ll do that, no matter what happens.
Fitz: No. No, no. It’s not important. Especially now. It’s… That’s… It’s just symbolic. It wouldn’t even change anything.
Coulson: Symbols are important. Institutions are important. People need things to believe in, Fitz. Especially now. People need hope.
Fitz: Okay.
Daisy: Okay, Coulson, we have visual contact. Can you hear me?
Coulson: Five by five.
Daisy: Same here. Loud and clear. How you feeling?
Coulson: Well, you know, what are the odds there’s a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man down there?
May: Shoot first, ask questions later.
Coulson: Copy that. I’m at the basement. Here we go.
Daisy: Coulson. Coulson!
Mack: Now what?
Fitz: Now we wait.
Coulson: Daisy, do you read me? Daisy? I’ll take that as a no. All right, Phil. Mr. Peterson?
Mike: Hello, Agent Coulson. It’s time I told you what’s really going on here. Nothing to be afraid of. Got no weapons. And I like the hazmat look on you, but I promise the air’s fine in here.
Coulson: You’re not here to hurt me? You’re gonna let me pass?
Mike: Do whatever you want. Shoot me if you like. After all, you’re the one that’s making this up.
Coulson: So you admit you’re not real. That I created you. In my head.
Mike: Of course. But you know there’s something deeper. And you’re here to face it.
Coulson: Face my fear?
Mike: How am I your fear, Phil? No, I mean face facts.
Coulson: What facts?
Mike: That this is all in your head.
Coulson: Are you telling me that I’m still in Tahiti?
Mike: No, Coulson, I’m telling you that you’ve never been to Tahiti. Or Malta or Puerto Rico or outer space or the Framework or the future. You’re on the table, Coulson, code blue.
Daisy: We can’t just wait around.
May: He wanted us to do just that. We hang tight.
Fitz: No one else can go down there. He wouldn’t know what’s real.
Simmons: That would make it even more dangerous.
Fitz: It would be a friendly-fire nightmare.
Daisy: We can’t just let him die! How do you not have a better plan?
Fitz: One life’s better than two. That’s simple mathematics, Daisy.
Daisy: There are no acceptable losses. This isn’t Hydra, Leopold.
Simmons: All right, calm down.
May: He’ll make it.
Mack: Come on, sir. You can do this.
Coulson: Okay, Phil, back to work. Don’t pay attention. This makes no sense.
Mike: What makes more sense? You tell me. That you were brought back from the dead after many days? Your mind programmed with false memories? In a world with alternate realities and rocks that tear holes in space-time? Or that your brain is being stimulated with electricity to revive it, and your conscience is trying to make sense of random synapses firing off in your brain?
Coulson: That’s not true.
Mike: You know it’s true. Loki ran a scepter through your heart, and we are desperately trying to bring you back.
Man: Charge 200.
Mike: But it isn’t working.
Man: Clear.
Woman: Negative. Asystolic.
Man: Mr. Stark said anything he needs.
Coulson: No, no, no, no. No. I’ve been through too much. I’m not gonna let this nightmare get to me.
Mike: Nightmare? This whole thing has been a dream. And every time the dream is too random or doesn’t reconcile with a memory, your mind creates a scenario to make it work.
Coulson: See, now you’re losing me. What does that even mean?
Mike: You really think your skull caught on fire, Phil? Or does it hurt to have electrodes on your scalp for this long? You think there was an alternate reality where you were a history teacher? Or were you remembering your father, who was a history teacher?
Coulson: Okay, stop.
Mike: You’re reliving mementos of your life mixed with the dreams you wish had come true.
Coulson: No, Mike. This is fear. I thought I’d come to terms with death, but this is my fear of it manifesting, because it’s harder to let go of than I thought it would be.
Mike: Yes. You’re struggling to let go. At least now you admit you’re dying. What’s the hardest part?
Coulson: The life I have yet to live.
Mike: And that’s why your mind created this story, where you spent years doing all the things you never got a chance to do. To vacation on a white beach with blue water. To travel to the stars. To own your own plane, a car that flies, your own team. To have a family. The brilliant students you never got a chance to mentor. The daughter you never had. And above all, a chance to be a hero. You said it yourself, Coulson. It matters who you are.
Coulson: No, I’m not trying to be a hero. I’m just here to see that S.H.I.E.L.D. continues.
Mike: Remember Daisy’s words. There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. There is nothing without you. This is all in your head.
Coulson: I refuse to believe this.
Mike: That’s your problem. You won’t let reality sink in. Even now, your mind is rejecting the fact that I’m just an EMT standing over you. It’s trying to make me into something else. It’s trying to find a way out.
May: Aircraft. Incoming.
Mack: They found us.
Simmons: Did Deke get caught?
Daisy: It’s a Quinjet.
Davis: Repeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. 313, requesting permission to land. Do you read?
Coulson: You don’t know what those people mean to me. Don’t say that they’re nothing. Don’t say that.
Mike: No. No, they’re a reflection of you. Who you truly are. One of the good ones. The real deal. You’ve still got that thing there. And I’m not trying to take it from you. I’m not trying to stop you. After all, look. You’re literally walking into the light. You’re ready. Let’s go together.
Coulson: Sorry, Mike. I’m not buying it.
Mike: Then I’ll take you myself.
Mike: What are you doing, Coulson? Pick up the doodad. Let’s go!
Coulson: You’re, uh, you’re real, right? Please tell me you’re real.
Mike: Would that make this any less awkward?
Coulson: Yeah.
Mike: Good.
Lee: Prints and DNA came back, ma'am. Deke Shaw? He’s no one. As in, no record at all. Could be a Life Model Decoy. And we’re getting calls from towns at the lakefront, more Daisy Johnson sightings. Do you want us to chase them?
Hale: She’s either on her way to Canada, or this entire thing is a smokescreen. Pack it up.
Fitz: The gravity field’s keeping the rift contained, for now. It’s a Band-Aid. We’ll need a more powerful solve, but the anomalies are fading, no new ones are occurring. We have one man to thank for that.
Deke: Oh, come on. That’s overstating it, but, still, it means a lot coming from you two. I mean, obviously, it was pretty touch and go up there for a while, but I called around to tell the Daisy Johnson story and was able to get everything off the checklist, though no one had ever heard of Haig, so I got something even better. But, yeah, I’m not gonna lie, I was pretty freaked out when I punched the coordinates into the phone and it led me into the middle of a grassy field. And it’s like, “Can the Quinjet get here a little bit quicker, please,” You know? But I managed to grave the critters. Pro tip, tuck your pants into your shoes. Nothing gets up.
Fitz: I was obviously talking about Deathlok.
Coulson: Goes without saying.
Fitz: Is he sticking around?
Coulson: No. He rolls solo. He stepped up, helped some Agents on the run. Helped Agent Davis find medical help. But he said he’s leaving after tonight’s festivities.
Fitz: Well, I mean, his arrival was perfect timing. Uncanny, really. Just what we needed.
Coulson: Yeah.
Fitz: What exactly were you up against down there, sir?
Coulson: Fitz, are you stalling?
Fitz: Me? Am I stalling just now? I don’t think so.
Coulson: Because the elevator stopped like a minute ago. It’s gonna be great.
Fitz: Wow. You look stunning.
Simmons: I’m pinned into this thing in 30 different places. It was the, um, only wedding dress at the secondhand shop, apparently. They couldn’t find you a kilt?
Fitz: Uh, no.
Coulson: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today for a moment we all knew was coming, some of us even before these two did, and I think we can all agree that to wait even one second to do this is playing with fire. All in favor?
May, Daisy, Mack, Piper: Aye.
Coulson: The ayes have it. So, all right. Time for the exchanging of the vows, I guess.
Deke: So, you bride’s side or groom’s side?
Mike: I know them both.
Simmons: I had to write it down. Fitz. I knew from the moment I saw you, from our first conversation about dielectric polarization, that you’d be in my life for a long time. But I didn’t know you would be my life. My heart. My home. We joined this team for adventures and got more than we had hoped, but I can’t wait for our next adventure, building a family together. My love for you ‭grows deeper and always will, no matter where ‭the universe takes us next.
Deke: So, you full cyborg? Or?
Mike: Yeah.
Deke: Cool.
Coulson: Agent Fitz?
Fitz: Um, Okay, um, I have been thinking about what to say. Just Words don’t really seem enough. I think that you are perfect. And, um, I don’t deserve you, Jemma. I don’t. I don’t deserve you. And I’m well-aware that I’m the luckiest man on any planet.
Coulson: Okay. Let’s have the rings. Quickly, please, before this forest collapses around us. Okay, Fitz, repeat after me. “With this ring…”
Fitz: With this ring…
Coulson: “… I thee wed.”
Fitz: … I thee wed.
Mike: So, you got the rings, huh? It’s a nice one.
Deke: Turns out a lot of people pawn wedding rings. I had to find one that was gonna be small enough for his little-boy fingers. And then, for hers, found this ring that looks just like this one that my mom used to wear sometimes. It was my grandma’s, I think.
Hale: You got something?
Lee: I don’t know. Thinking Deke Shaw could possibly be an LMD, I ran a genetic profile to see if he was biologically linked to anyone.
Hale: And it came up with a match?
Lee: No. It came up with two.
Coulson: Now, by the powers vested in me by, well, by the two of you, I am so happy to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
Mike: So, what about you, bride or groom?
Deke: Uh, I mean, to be honest, I don’t really know either one of them.
