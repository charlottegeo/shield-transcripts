Garrett: Tower, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. Echo-3. I got a pair of UAVs on my six. These friendlies? Over. They’re gonna hit my jet wash, they get any closer. What is that?
Coulson: Drop the weapon.
May: Coulson…
Coulson: Drop the damn weapon and kick it over to the stairs, May, now! Now! Now back the hell up! Over there! Talk. Tell us where you rerouted the plane.
May: I didn’t set this new course. I swear!
Coulson: Don’t lie to me!
Fitz: Yeah, well, the plane just turned around, for god’s sake!
Skye: How is this happening, then?
May: H.Q. can override automated control of the avionics, take us anywhere they want. Let me check the instrument panel, and I’ll be able…
Fitz: No way!
Coulson: You’re not going anywhere till you explain what…
May: It’s not me!
Coulson: Why did you have an encrypted hard line?
Fitz: And try to shoot me when we found it?
May: Let’s take a breath, huh?
Coulson: Let’s not!
May: It was a dedicated channel… to Director Fury. That’s the truth.
Coulson: Director Fury? I haven’t been able to get him on the line for weeks.
Skye: You were reporting to him?
May: That’s all I can tell you.
Fitz: Oh, just come out with it!
Coulson: That’s all you can tell us?!
May: I’m under orders! Fury will tell you.
Fitz: What… was this an order? To shoot me in the bloody head?
Coulson: Hold on. We’re not headed to Fury anymore.
May: I don’t know where we’re headed. And I can’t get Fury on the line because Fitz cut the line!
Fitz: Skye told me to!
Skye: Someone was talking to the Clairvoyant, the real Clairvoyant.
May: You were in the walls, Fitz. You want to explain why you were tampering with the plane’s sat cable?
Fitz: Sure, because that’s relevant! Don’t try and turn this around on me!
Coulson: Fitz.
Fitz: I was trying to speak to Simmons at the Hub.
Coulson: And you needed an encrypted line? What’s so secret that you…
Fitz: Well, you tell me! Simmons and I know you two have been whispering, keeping things from us, about the drug that saved your life. Simmons is just trying to figure out how the whole thing works!
May: Fitz. Who is she talking to?
Coulson: Fitz, open the door.
Fitz: No way, not until we sort this out. I’m not opening anything.
Coulson: Open the door. We can’t get anything sorted until you open the damn door! Skye, get your laptop hooked up to our systems. See if you can pull up any S.H.I.E.L.D. communications. I want to know where this plane is headed and why.
May: Coulson…
Coulson: You stay put! Now tell me who Simmons is talking to. ‘Cause if it isn’t someone we trust, she’s in serious danger.
Triplett: Agent Simmons. I was wondering where you snuck off to. You busy?
Simmons: Yes, but that’s okay.
Triplett: It’s noisy here today. A lot of guys in action mode.
Simmons: I asked around. Guess it’s a level eight operation of some sort.
Triplett: Mm.
Simmons: I was surprised to have this room to myself.
Triplett: So, what are you working on? Wow. Coulson’s team is awfully secretive, even for this organization. Are you hiding something, agent?
Simmons: No. It’s just nothing important.
Triplett: I hope not. Because I remember us tracking down a drug that brought a girl back from the brink, and that was real important.
Simmons: Yes. I know.
Triplett: Come to think of it, I don’t remember seeing it in the dispatches, or you mentioning it when Agent Blake got his ribs caved in.
Simmons: I wasn’t in a positi…
Triplett: ‘Cause if you had the means and you didn’t use them, that blood is all over your hands, too.
Simmons: I know. I’m trying. Look. Men died to keep this secret. We don’t understand why, so we wanted to keep our research in-house for safety.
Triplett: Research?
Simmons: That’s hit a dead end. I’m uploading Skye’s blood scans. I would like to contact Agent Weaver at S.H.I.E.L.D. academy covertly.
Triplett: For a little help.
Simmons: But we must keep this between us. Please, I don’t want any… trouble.
Triplett: You’re level five? My level-six clearance gives me access to the holobox… secure line.
Simmons: But we can’t sneak that in here, can we?
Triplett: Agent Hand seems to be keeping everyone busy. We’ll be good. But, hey, we get questioned, let me talk. You’re a surprisingly bad liar, Agent Simmons.
Simmons: I know. But I’m getting better at it.
Coulson: What do you mean, “noise?”
Skye: I mean literally noise across every S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel. Some sort of blanket signal.
Fitz: Encoded data, maybe.
Skye: I think so.
Coulson: You want to fill us in? We root you out, a mole, suddenly our plane shuts down, our communications jammed.
May: I don’t know what’s happening. I wish I did. You have to believe me.
Coulson: No, I don’t.
Garrett: Do you read? Do you read, 6-1-6?
Fitz: Where’s that coming from?
Skye: Close.
Garrett: Enemy aircraft on my tail. Over.
Coulson: Garrett?
Garrett: Coulson, I’m under attack. Drones. Repeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. drones are on my ass. We’re not getting along. Do you copy?
Coulson: Copy. Garrett, what’s happening? We’ve lost control of our aircraft.
Garrett: Hell if I know. Tell me you got guns on that thing. I’m coming to you.
May: Ohh!
Coulson: Fitz, can you manually wire the guns to weapons control, bypass our system?
Fitz: If I have cables long enough, yeah.
Coulson: Skye, decode the signal. We need to get ahead of this. I don’t want any more surprises today.
Ward: What happened?
Coulson: She’s a sleeper. I mean the other kind of sleeper.
Ward: Wait. What are you saying?
Coulson: She’s been reporting on us this whole time.
Fitz: Controls are live, sir.
Coulson: Garrett, what’s your 20?
Garrett: I’ll be on top of you in seconds at your 10:00. Guns hot?
Coulson: Warming up.
Fitz: He needs to pull up, sir. Hey. Hey! Garrett, pull up!
Coulson: He knows what he’s doing.
Coulson: Damn it.
Garrett: That’s Joanie. Any thoughts on chachi? Now it knows you’re here.
Coulson: Want to roll over, play dead?
Garrett: Okay, Phil, but you better make it quick. I’m running on fumes. I’ll pull up even of your six. Better not miss.
Coulson: Copy that.
Garrett: Ready when you are, boss.
Fitz: “Play dead.” What does that mean?
Coulson: That means… I better not miss. Boo-yah.
Barbour: The drones are down. Agent Garrett’s alive and docking with S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6.
Jacobson: I suggest we send more men, shoot that airplane out of the sky.
Hand: No. We couldn’t seize automated control of Garrett’s jet, so I wrote it off as a loss. But now that he’s with Coulson, we can cross him off with the rest when they land. Preserve the aircraft. You got something to say, Agent Shaw?
Shaw: Apologies, ma'am. I’m just having a hard time killing the people we once called friends.
Hand: Once that encoded transmission went out, everything changed. You understand that, don’t you? We swore allegiance to each other. And today, that loyalty will be tested. If you waver… you die.
Skye: It’s a simple message repeated. Semantic encoding. I needed to find the mnemonic key. It should only take me a minute more to decipher.
Garrett: Can I ask the obvious question? What the hell?!
Coulson: We don’t know. We don’t even know where our plane is headed.
Garrett: Oh, I saw your trajectory. You’re being tractor-beamed straight to the Hub. Those drones were launched out of there for sure.
Coulson: Victoria Hand.
Fitz: Hand? Can’t be.
Garrett: It can’t be what, now?
Skye: The Clairvoyant.
Garrett: I thought Ward capped that guy.
Coulson: I don’t believe the man Ward killed was the Clairvoyant. I think he was an unwitting decoy meant to end our investigation.
Garrett: That’s a lot of trouble to go through for a red herring, don’t you think?
Coulson: Because the Clairvoyant is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent using high-level clearance to stay ahead of us, make it seem like she’s got psychic abilities.
Garrett: “She?” You think Victoria Hand’s the Clairvoyant? I don’t mean to pee in the punch bowl, but that doesn’t make a lot of sense. I was stationed with Vic in Lisbon. She’s a hard-ass and a buzzkill at parties, I grant you, but do you really think she’s capable of that?
Coulson: Excuse me. Didn’t she just try to blow you out of the sky?
Garrett: Don’t get me wrong… she’s definitely gone nuts, but her actions prove she’s not the Clairvoyant, right? I mean, if she’s been hiding in plain sight all this time, why reveal herself now?
Skye: Guys.
Coulson: “Out of the shadows, into the light.”
Garrett: Well, I’ll be.
Fitz: I thought Hydra was defeated after World War II.
Coulson: It was. S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded in the wake of that victory.
Fitz: And now they’re back?
Garrett: Hydra always comes back.
Coulson: Cut off a head, two more will take its place.
Garrett: Is it a head? I thought it was a limb.
Fitz: No, no, no. “Cut off a head.”
Coulson: It’s a head.
Skye: But it was sent from a S.H.I.E.L.D. source. It’s got to be some sort of activation signal to Hydra members within S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson: Hand must be one of them.
Fitz: Okay, stop. Stop. W-what does that mean? In S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Garrett: Targeting level-eight agents, seizing power. Wonder how deep it goes.
Skye: The signal’s everywhere. Deep.
Coulson: You know what this means?
Garrett: Yeah. We’re screwed.
Coulson: We can’t change course, and we have no idea what’s waiting for us at the Hub.
Fitz: The Hub.
Garrett: I say we blow a hole in the side of this puppy and parachute out, live to fight another day.
Coulson: We can’t.
Garrett: It’s a cherry ride, I’ll give you that, but let’s not just hand over the keys.
Fitz: Simmons is at the Hub. We have to save her.
Garrett: Oh, crap. Yeah. Trip’s there, too. I don’t mind saying I don’t like the odds on this one. We should let your specialists out of their cage. We can use every weapon we can get.
Skye: We’ve got to save her.
Coulson: So we’ll fly in there, face the music… even if it is the Hydra theme song.
Barbour: Agents Triplett and Simmons are unaccounted for, ma'am.
Jacobson: Searches are under way. They don’t have anywhere to go.
Hand: Don’t underestimate Coulson’s people. Tie up those loose ends.
Simmons: You’re positive this line is secure?
Triplett: Yeah, but be quick. Nothing looks more guilty than sneaking around.
Simmons: Well, I sent her a request. She must not have… Agent Weaver, thank you for joining me. I’d been hop…
Weaver: Jemma. Thank god you’re still alive.
Simmons: What? What’s wrong?
Weaver: The Hub still secure? Are you with your team? Get somewhere safe and lock the door.
Simmons: What’s happening?
Weaver: Have your commander report that the academy is under sieze. We don’t know how long Hydra’s been inside S.H.I.E.L.D. They are taking control!
Simmons: Hydra? What? Where?
Weaver: Everywhere! Among us! If you survive, you know where to find me. Jemma, don’t trust anyone!
Simmons: What are you doing?
Triplett: What the lady said to do, locking the door.
Simmons: Let me out.
Triplett: Go ahead. This door won’t hold if they come looking, but they won’t come around this way for a little while. I’m staying.
Simmons: Well, how do I… know I can trust you?
Triplett: Because I’m trustworthy. You’re the one who works for the zombie robot back from the dead. Take it. If you try to kill me with it, I’ll know I can’t trust you. Now fire that thing back up. Let’s see if we can get our friends on the line. Can’t wait to tell them the good news.
Ward: Coulson said you’re an informant. Want to elaborate on that?
May: No, I don’t. Damn icer. My head’s killing me.
Ward: I deserve to know.
May: Don’t start with that. We do our jobs. End of story. I can’t tell you any more until Fury gives the go-ahead.
Ward: You’re good. I mean, I always heard you were good. But, man… playing us this whole time, conning me, Coulson.
May: I wasn’t playing anyone. I had your backs.
Ward: And reported on us behind them. You know, you always said to keep my emotions in check. But this is some next-level…
May: And you should have listened. You killed a man in cold blood, let your emotions get the best of you.
Ward: It was to protect our team from a monster!
May: It was to protect her! Which would be okay if you hadn’t shot the wrong guy.
Coulson: Fitz repaired your direct line. If you have the ability to make this right, now’s the time, 'cause you can’t make it worse.
May: I have orders not to do this with anyone else present.
Coulson: They’re taking out our guns. Get director Fury on the line, or I’ll march you out there first.
Ward: Sir, what is going on?
Garrett: A whole lot.
Ward: Who is shooting at us?
Garrett: Come here. Let me catch you up. Apparently, Agent Hand is the Clairvoyant, so chew on that first.
May: Agent Melinda May. Voice command. Emergency protocol one. Emergency protocol one.
Man: Hello.
May: This is an X10 straight connection to Director Fury’s personal line. Where is he?
Man: Director Fury is dead.
Ward: Can that be true about Fury?
Garrett: Man was my S.O. Coulson’s, too. Proved himself more than once to be a hard man to kill. That sound outside doesn’t bode well, though. Is there anything on this plane you don’t want them to get their hands on?
May: That was his direct line, Phil.
Coulson: So it’s real. That means it’s just you and me, unless there were other parties you reported to.
May: There weren’t.
Coulson: Then come out with it. Fury’s gone. We’re being shot at by our own people.
May: Fury knew you’d want me to join up, asked me to keep an eye on you.
Coulson: Looking for what?
May: Signs of physical or mental deterioration, to keep him updated. It’s that simple.
Coulson: Did you know about Tahiti? How could you do that to me? After all we’ve been through, the years we spent together in ops…
May: He said it was essential you couldn’t know.
Coulson: The time I spent sifting through the ashes with you in Bahrain? I gave you a second chance when I assembled this team…
May: I assembled this team!
Coulson: What?
May: I evaluated what was needed, and I gave the assessment to Fury, and he gave you the parameters for your unit.
Coulson: What was needed, May?
May: Someone who could repair your body, a technician who could reprogram your brain, and a specialist to help me put you down if it had to be done. But I didn’t do it for Fury. I did it for you, to protect you! I… You mean a lot to me. A lot. To hear you were dead… you may not believe me, but that’s the truth. And I have nothing to do with the Clairvoyant or this Hydra threat we’re up against. Hopefully this helps prove that.
Coulson: I want to believe you… but you’ve used that against me this whole time.
Ward: They stopped firing. No clear shots through the windows.
May: They want to preserve the aircraft. A surgical strike team is next.
Ward: Fitz cut the hydraulics on the cargo ramp. They’ll have to pry it open.
Coulson: That won’t hold them long. We need to plan to get out of here with whatever we can take with us.
Ward: About that. The 0-8-4 specs, Asgardian weaponry, portal creation, Donnie’s weather machine. If they get their hands on gravitonium in the fridge…
Coulson: It’s below the fridge. No records.
Ward: Okay, but on the off-chance we’d give them the designs to weaponize it. The drug from Tahiti, sir? All here. If Hydra is really about to seize this plane…
Coulson: We should wipe the system.
Skye: I’m backing it up on this hard drive to keep our edge.
Coulson: Then do it. Scrub the plane clean.
Skye: It’ll take some time.
Garrett: We’re working on buying you some.
Simmons: I’m telling you, this signal is clogging everything up. Something terrible has happened.
Barbour: Freeze! Show me your hands! Show me your hands.
Agent 1: Go! Go!
Agent 2: Move! Move!
Fitz: It’s called a mouse hole. Cuts through anything, really. I designed it a year ago and submitted it for testing, but it never reached distribution.
Garrett: Top agents always hog the good stuff.
Skye: You’re right. The hard drive’s safer in your hands. You haven’t taught me how to hold up under torture yet.
Ward: We’ll get to that. It’s real fun.
Coulson: All right. Here’s where we split. Skye and Ward? Heading to the nerve center. Disable their systems, most importantly, their control of our plane.
Skye: Copy that.
Coulson: Remember, these agents are under orders. Use icers only. We’ll find Simmons, get her out.
Garrett: We should go straight for Hand. Hydra’s always talking about getting their heads cut off, right?
Coulson: Saving Simmons and Triplett… that’s our priority.
Garrett: I agree, and that’s how I’d get it done. Hope you have a better plan.
May: Phil, I can help you if you…
Coulson: We need your help, but the cuffs stay on.
Hand: The rest of your possibly very short lives hinges on this moment. Hydra has successfully infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. at the highest level. It only took seven decades, and today is our coming-out party. We have the support of the level-9 and level-10 agents. And those who have resisted Hydra have been crossed off… Director Fury included. I’m here to offer you a choice, and a simple one at that. Either swear unwavering loyalty to Hydra right now for all time… or share Fury’s fate. I won’t wait long.
Triplett: Cross us off… and one of you goes, too.
Hand: Right answer. The number of people I trust is now seven. Where are we on the roundup?
Jacobson: We’re moving all agents below level five to East holding. I have men monitoring microphones placed in most of the rooms.
Hand: And our strike team?
Jacobson: Has stormed the plane, yes.
Simmons: That was a… a test?
Hand: That very few have passed.
Simmons: I thought we were dead. You’re not Hydra. Thank god.
Hand: Well, don’t celebrate just yet. We may not be Hydra, but your friend Coulson… he is.
Baylin: Oh. We captured Agent Coulson and the cavalry herself. Call upstairs. They’ll need assistance. They’re headed to… here.
Garrett: We caught 'em, the slippery bastards. Agent May took one of mine in the arm. Softy there wouldn’t let her bleed out.
Baylin: Whoa. Do you need medical assistance?
Garrett: Just your sidearm.
Fitz: Okay, come on, Simmons. Where are you?
Hand: Report back to me.
Agent: Yes ma'am.
Hand: What?
Shaw: We’ve searched the plane, ma'am. No sign of it. They were on board when it landed. We are tearing this plane apart. They must have… snuck off somehow.
Hand: Check the tunnels. I want two squads posted in every corridor. Capture who you can, but you have permission to use lethal force.
Agent: Yes, ma'am. You were right. We should have blown that plane out of the sky.
Simmons: Are you mad? How can you be saying this?
Hand: Hydra won’t show mercy. Neither can we.
Simmons: There is no way Coulson is Hydra! He is a good man, a friend!
Hand: He’s a liar! Agent Blake came to me with his suspicions… that Coulson and the other level eights were involved in some sort of conspiracy. Then Coulson sent him on an op that put him in the I.C.U.
Simmons: Coulson is not capable of what you’re insinuating.
Hand: Agent Jacobson, Coulson’s crimes?
Jacobson: Recruiting known enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D., disobeying a direct order… multiple counts, violation of international law.
Hand: To rescue our beloved Professor Hall, who ended up dead by his hand.
Jacobson: Failure to report the crimes of his protégé, Akela Amador.
Hand: Whose same technology somehow ended up in the head of Mr. Peterson, and you know his crimes.
Simmons: You helped us save Coulson from the Clairvoyant.
Hand: Yet when we found this brain-dead Clairvoyant, Coulson’s man Ward shot him before we could learn a single thing about him. The lies add up, Agent Simmons. Are you telling me he’s never kept a secret from you? The worst thing you can do right now is to underestimate Hydra. They hide in plain sight. They earn our trust, our sympathy. They make us like them. And when you hesitate, they strike. If we’re to survive, we must learn to strike first.
Ward: Damn.
Skye: That processing center is at the end of that hall.
Ward: Give me your icer.
Skye: What are you gonna do?
Ward: Pave the way for you.
Skye: There’s like a hundred guys out there.
Ward: 12. Level-five foot soldiers, basic armor package, and no other way through. The others are depending on us.
Skye: But it’s suicide.
Ward: Not if I don’t die. And if I do…
Skye: Wh… slow down.
Ward: … maybe I deserve to. I killed an innocent man, Skye.
Skye: You didn’t know. You thought you were doing the right thing. You thought he was going to…
Ward: To hurt you.
Ward: If we make it out of this, maybe we can… grab a drink, you and me.
Skye: Are you…
Ward: Remember in that bar in Dublin, you offered to… talk? I didn’t want to talk. I needed to keep things compartmentalized.
Skye: Like with May? I’m not an idiot. We live on the same plane together, for god’s sake.
Ward: Well, with her, I knew I could. With you… I didn’t want to risk it.
Skye: I was offering to talk, Ward, not to have sex with you.
Ward: I’m not saying that. I’m saying… I want a chance to take you up on it, to have that talk. Look, I know I’m not that guy. I’m too locked-down, too boring.
Skye: When we make it out of this… yes, let’s have a drink. You said you might die, so… what the hell?
Ward: Lock the door behind me.
Ward: Aah!
Skye: Hey, you… You should really look up the word “boring” in a dictionary.
Ward: You ready to hack this system?
Skye: Who said anything about hacking?
May: There. Agent Hand. Outside the East wing situation room.
Garrett: This is definitely a situation.
Fitz: Is Simmons there? We don’t move until we find Simmons.
Garrett: I’ll say it again. Best bet to save her… use the ventilation system to get above the sit room. Drop down using Fitz’s sweet, little mouse hole, and put two bullets through Victoria Hand’s heart.
Fitz: Yeah, it’s an option, sir.
Coulson: Without questioning?
Garrett: Questioning what? Whether she wants to kill us fast or slow?
Coulson: Last time we did that, we shot the wrong man.
Garrett: Because she wanted us to! Phil, this is a battle for S.H.I.E.L.D.’s soul, and we’re on the front lines. History will remember us this day.
Coulson: That’s right. It’s for S.H.I.E.L.D.’s soul. And murder without consideration is a sure…
Garrett: “Consideration?” Consider this. She had one of my men killed with a bomb rigged to his gas pedal. The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren’t doing the backstroke.
May: But we can just as easily ice her.
Garrett: You don’t put someone like her on ice. She had Skye shot in the stomach… In the stomach… because she was curious. Mike Peterson… burned alive and turned into some kind of freak. She tortured you, using the same machine she used to brainwash that bitch in the flower dress. And right now, she’s probably doing the same to Agent Simmons. Oh, I’ve considered it plenty, my friend.
Fitz: No. Simmons will be fine.
Garrett: Just being realistic, kid.
Coulson: I never mentioned that.
Garrett: I’m telling you, killing her quick would be a mercy.
Coulson: I never said… Raina had been inside the machine. I never told that to anybody.
Garrett: I must have read it in a report, then.
Coulson: You weren’t with us.
Garrett: The point is, how many more have to suffer before Vic gets hers?
Coulson: You showed up right after.
Garrett: What are you driving at?
Coulson: After Skye was shot. Quinn said it was so I would lead the Clairvoyant to the cure. That’s exactly what I did. I walked you right in there with me.
Garrett: Phil… look. It’s been a rough day. I-I get it. But you need to take a second and… Damn it. 
Agent 1: Freeze!
Agent 2: Don’t move!
Agent 3: Hands where we can see them!
Garrett: Easy, fellas.
Coulson: Take Agent Garrett into custody. He’s the murderer they call the Clairvoyant. He’s a traitor.
Garrett: Gentlemen, I know Agent Sitwell was in charge of filling your ranks, so at least a few of you know what to do in this situation. Anytime, boys. Hail Hydra.
Agents: Hail Hydra!
Coulson: Those three men in your unit… I guess they asked the wrong questions.
Garrett: Until today, it was all about keeping the secret.
Fitz: Are you gonna kill us?
Garrett: That wasn’t my plan, really. If it was, I could have done that anytime I wanted. No, Coulson and I go way back, back to the days when Fury was teaching us tactics… Clearing corners, slicing the pie. Remember, Phil?
Coulson: Fury would bury you for this.
Garrett: Probably. Instead, he’ll just have to roll over in his grave. He must have uncovered our secret. Top brass did what they had to do. Explains why we’ve suddenly come “out of the shadows.” Not a minor inconvenience, I might add.
May: “Top brass?”
Garrett: Oh, my, yes. Tip-top. We had a good thing going, too… waving the S.H.I.E.L.D. flag as hard as we could. I guess we’ll be changing colors now.
Coulson: For Hydra? You really believe all that crap… spreading death and destruction?
Garrett: I wouldn’t say I’m a true believer. Let’s just say I felt the wind changing direction and swung my sail. You really should, too.
Coulson: I would die before serving Hydra, you sick son of a bitch.
Garrett: I hate to tell you, but… you’ve been serving Hydra all along. I guess death is the only alternative. It’s a sad thing. I consider you a friend. I was happy when I heard you’d made it through.
Coulson: So happy you had me tortured for three days to find out how they did it.
Garrett: I didn’t enjoy that. Phil, t-this is me being honest.
Coulson: No, John This is you being a psychopath.
Garrett: I know you’d follow him to the grave, so… As for you, Agent Fitz, you’ll hold a very high rank on our tech division if you volunteer. If not, you’ll have no rank and a lot of pain. Of course, either way, your services will be required.
Fitz: You’re gonna suffer for what you’ve done. And I… I plan on being a very big part of that.
Garrett: I like you, kid. All right. Let them have it. But shoot that one in the kneecaps.
Skye: Was that all of them?
Ward: It wasn’t as big as I thought…
Coulson: Aah!
Fitz: Coulson!
Agent 1: Hands up!
Agent 2: Drop your weapon!
Agent 1: Don’t move!
Coulson: I’m not Hydra.
Hand: We heard… everything.
Coulson: Who is? How deep does it go?
Hand: Captain America has defeated the helicarriers at the Triskelion. But his status is unknown.
Coulson: And S.H.I.E.L.D. has fallen.
Hand: Hydra factions have taken control of our East African headquarters and the Treehouse. And those are just the ones we know of.
Coulson: It’s gonna be a scramble, a power grab.
Hand: I’ll head to the fridge. At least that facility is secure.
Coulson: I don’t need to remind you how imperative it is that it stay that way.
Hand: And I’ll find Agent Garrett the smallest, darkest cell in the icebox.
Ward: I’d like to turn the key on that cell myself… if you don’t mind, sir. He was my S.O. I feel I… I should have known. It was my duty to…
Coulson: No one knew. I didn’t know. That’s how he beat us… by being a friend.
Ward: I spent years with that bastard. Looked up to him. I want to see him suffer.
Hand: Don’t mind the company, and I can always use a man of your skills. Pick up the pieces here at the Hub if you can, and, uh… Only communicate using one of these. You and I may be the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who aren’t Hydra or dead… not that that means anything now. All we have is each other. So stay in touch, Agent Coulson.
Coulson: I guess you can… call me Phil.
Skye: It’s all gone.
Simmons: In pieces, at least.
Coulson: Skye, try to restore some of the firmware in the plane’s systems. Fitz-Simmons, get a crew together. Help May patch the holes.
May: You still want me on board?
Coulson: You’re not a friend. But I do believe you’re an ally. We need all the allies we can get.
May: What are we planning to do next?
Coulson: Survive.
Jacobson: Course is locked, ma'am.
Hand: Good. He’s not telling stories now, is he? You know what I’m thinking, Agent Garrett? I’m thinking the icebox of the fridge is a little too comfortable for you. Maybe we should put you a little deeper underground. What do you think, Agent Ward? You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before. Care to shoot the right one?
Garrett: Did I tell you about this one time I was deep undercover? The Sicilian backup team a no-show, of course. So I dropped in through the skylight, used up my whole mag, and I hit the final guy in the chest with a flare gun. Boy, you should have seen the look on his face when that thing went off. Oh, man, he didn’t know what hit him. Now, that’s what I call in-flight entertainment.
