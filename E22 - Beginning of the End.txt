Zeller: Sorry about the security red tape… you know, intellectual property, blah, blah, blah. You’ll get used to it. So, basically, I’ve been here since day one. It started with me on my computer in a basement, and now look what we’ve grown into. We’ve got 20 active systems, and we’re growing fast.
Fletcher: I was gonna ask about the construction next door.
Zeller: Ah, yeah, we’re planning to add another 100 systems by the end of the month. That’s Sally. Hey, Sally. So, what… are you just really into this sort of thing, or what brings you to the company?
Fletcher: Um… the Incentives program?
Zeller: Yeah. No one’s turned that down yet. Anyway, so, every operator is in charge of one unit. You will receive an e-mail 24 hours before it goes online. Now, some are volunteers, but some are here for the same reason that you’re here…
Woman: Hey, Zeller. We’re in position.
Zeller: Okay. This is good for you to learn on your first day.
Fletcher: What’s going on?
Zeller: These guys? We don’t like these guys. Yes, sir, we have them in sight. Copy that. Okay, people… let ‘em have it.
Coulson: Could sure use a little light in here.
Triplett: I got this.
Coulson: So, who do we talk to about getting a haircut?
Centipede Soldier: If it isn’t the Cavalry.
May: Don’t ever call me that.
Coulson: Bring the house down. Time to go!
May: Aah!
Coulson: Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go.
Zeller: Our men are still digging themselves out, but it looks like Coulson and the others got away. Do you want to…
Garrett: Doesn’t matter.
Ward: You all right?
Garrett: What does it look like? Never better, son. I need a nail. Get me a nail… a big one!
Quinn: What the hell is he doing?
Raina: He’s flexing his new muscles. He has every ounce of our research coursing through his veins. He feels good.
Quinn: Because he took all of our miracle drug. When we land at Cybertek, military brass and investors are expecting a demonstration, and I promised them indestructible super soldiers, not disposable ones.
Raina: Well, with Hydra in the mix, we won’t lack for volunteers. And if we run out, our Incentives program should help fill the ranks.
Garrett: Just getting some ideas down. I can’t keep everything in my head.
Ward: Got to be honest with you, John, looks like you’re kind of losing it.
Garrett: I’m alive for the first time, thanks to you. We took some hits along the way, but we did it. We did it.
Ward: Can’t believe it. This is everything we’ve been working towards, saving you. Our alliance with Hydra was always a means to that end, right?
Garrett: Symbiotic.
Ward: And here we are. I mean, it’s not like we’re true believers, right? Don’t get me wrong. I’ll go where you go. Having our soldiers in key positions is great, but… then what? Are we really planning a coup?
Garrett: It’s more of an uprising. It’s become bigger than Hydra. Ward, you’ve taken good care of me, gave me everything I wanted. It’s time for you to decide what it is you want. I’ll see that you get it, too, son. I can do anything now.
Skye: The trojan horse worked. It gave us access to the system we wanted. Our secret weapon… we now have eyes on their operation right in the palm of my hand.
Triplett: We’ll need more than eyes to defeat Garrett.
May: What is it?
Coulson: Fitz-Simmons’ tracker crossed the ocean. It’s in New Mexico.
Skye: They managed to tag the plane?
Coulson: It appears so, but they’re not answering.
Skye: No…
Coulson: We can’t think about that right now. They may have been captured. Either way, they risked everything to put a tracker on that plane for us. Now we know exactly where Garrett is, and Skye can see what he’s doing. If Fitz and Simmons are still alive, then catching Garrett is our only shot at finding them.
Fitz: You looked very peaceful sleeping. Didn’t want to wake you, but I’m glad that you’re up.
Simmons: What’s happening?
Fitz: I’ve spent the last hour trying to figure out why we sank. We’re at the bottom of the ocean, in case you missed that bit. These pods are built to be compatible with all S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft, submarines, spacecraft. On impact, the atmospheric adaptation must have tried to compensate. We slowly sank as it increased the density of the outer walls. I measured the rate the water rose on the glass. Did the math… we’re at least 90 feet down. You can’t see the surface.
Simmons: How did we survive the fall?
Fitz: The plane must have been in vertical flight mode, flying low. I managed to strap us to one of the backboards before we hit. And I broke my arm… same two places I broke it in second grade… which is strange.
Simmons: I thought we were dead for sure, Fitz. We’re so lucky. Now we just need to figure a way out of here. We’ll find a way out of here, right?
Fitz: And then we’d be in the middle of the ocean with the bends and no floatation and no one looking for us. I already spent an hour trying to rig the wireless signals on the EKG to send out a weak distress call before remembering that it’s a S.H.I.E.L.D. frequency and no one’s listening. And that’s not the problem… the problem is that there aren’t many supplies left in here, so I’ve already done the math…
Simmons: Enough with the math. What are you saying? There is no way out. We’re going to die down here.
Coulson: We’ll only get one shot at this, so let’s go over the plan one more time to make sure we’re clear on exactly what we’re doing, okay? Trip and I will crest the ridge, use a noisemaker to grab a three-wheel, maybe something with more fireworks, and open a window for you two. You crawl in, grab the dealer, force his hand. He’ll get us our ace in the hole, and then bob’s your uncle.
Skye: Roger that.
Triplett:  Makes it sound easy.
May: Coulson, it’s a solid plan you’ve mapped out, but it hinges on a gamble… a big one.
Coulson: And backup isn’t coming. It’ll be just the four of us. We’ll be outmanned and outgunned. But Fury always said… a man can accomplish anything when he realizes he’s a part of something bigger. A team of people who share that conviction can change the world. So, what do you say? You ready to change the world?
May: No. I’m ready to kick some ass.
Coulson: That works, too.
Ward: I’m saying, just talk to him. He says everything’s fine, but he’s not acting that way. I don’t know what’s going on with him, and I don’t like it.
Raina: Captivating, isn’t it?
Garrett: First time I saw it, it reminded me of a lava lamp. Of course, that was before I could see through it.
Raina: Quinn’s expecting the gravitonium as payment. When he’s done, I think it would be wise to let him have it.
Garrett: Don’t be coy. I know you have plans for the stuff. I understand it now. I can see its soul. I can see yours, too.
Ward: Ward’s concerned you’re going mad.
Garrett: The drug didn’t just strengthen my body. It gave me clarity of mind. It gave me a vision of the world that’s waiting beneath the surface of this world. You don’t think that’s mad, do you? You know exactly what I’m talking about. You always have.
Raina: I have no allegiance to Hydra, Centipede, Cybertek… you. I was only ever interested in…
Garrett: Evolution. You know we’re prehistoric creatures oozing out of the swamps, through the mist, clawing our way onto land so we can finally stand or plant roots… or fly.
Raina: Exactly. I was saddened to learn you weren’t Clairvoyant. I had a question I didn’t get to ask, but now…
Garrett: Now the truth is written on the back of my eyes, so… go ahead, Flowers. Ask.
Raina: What will I become?
Simmons: Are you scared?
Fitz: Yeah. And I’m hungry, too.
Simmons: Me too… scared and hungry. What do you think it’s like?
Fitz: Death? Well, depends on the method, really. Drowning’s supposed to be quite pleasant in the end, apparently. Once the water fills up your lungs…
Simmons: I mean after.
Fitz: Ah, yeah. Well, my mum always said that you shouldn’t be afraid because it’s just like the way life was before you were born… which wasn’t that bad, was it?
Simmons: That’s sweet… Though, apparently, I was miserable before I was born… upside down, umbilical cord all wrapped around my head.
Fitz: Yeah, well, she meant pre-conception, of cour…
Simmons: I know. I’m joking.
Fitz: Yeah, I know that you’re joking. That’s fine.
Simmons: I like to think about the first law of thermodynamics, that no energy in the universe is created…
Fitz & Simmons: … and none is destroyed.
Simmons: That means that every bit of energy inside us, every particle will go on to be a part of something else, maybe live as a dragonfish, a microbe, maybe burn in a supernova 10 billion years from now. And every part of us now was once a part of some other thing… a moon, a storm cloud, a mammoth.
Fitz: A monkey.
Simmons: A monkey. Thousands and thousands of other beautiful things that were just as terrified to die as we are. We gave them new life… a good one, I hope. It’s fitting we’re down here together, Fitz. This is where all life began on our planet, anyway… Just outside that glass…
Fitz: Jemma… What?
Simmons: The glass. Fitz, the glass!
Fitz: Yeah. It’s bulletproof, pressure-resistant.
Simmons: But the seal is 4-hydroxy- 4-methyl-2-pentanone, surely.
Fitz: Yeah, I know what you’re thinking, but the flash point is too high for it to burn.
Simmons: But medical ethanol has a low flash point, and it burns…
Fitz: Hotter. If we could use the defibrillator as an ignition source…
Simmons: And build a compressed explosive…
Fitz: To ignite the seal, the outside pressure will…
Fitz & Simmons: …blow the window in!
Fitz: Yes, yes, yes, yes! This really hurts my arm.
Simmons: Okay. Well, now we know that, there’s a whole new set of problems, but where do we start?
Quinn: And finally, welcome to our cybernetics subsection, where we design, manufacture, and, with this, install our most advanced system. Ladies and gentlemen, this prototype can replace the severed limb of a soldier in minutes with one 10 times stronger, fully networked to the soldier’s biometrics and to his optical targeting system.
Jacobs: If you want me to open up Uncle Sam’s checkbook, I’m gonna need specifics.
Quinn: Specifics. Specifically, I’d like to build dozens of these machines, increase the scale of our surgery wing, crank out 100 soldiers a day.
Jacobs: To join our special ops units.
Quinn: No, to replace them. Navy Seals, Secret Service. Now, gentlemen, we know the world’s a dangerous place now. What we’re offering you is… security.
Coulson: All right, what do we want? There’s a three-wheel over there.
Triplett: Here comes a Humvee that has better fireworks.
Coulson: Hold on.
Triplett: Now, that’s what I’m talking about.
Coulson: Did you bring a noisemaker?
Triplett: Sir, I bring the noise and the funk wherever I go.
Man: Hey-ho, friends! The enemy approaches. Careful, now, or they’ll win the day.
Man: Move! Over there. Over there!
Triplett: Hey.
Man: Ohh!
Coulson: You know where to put this next one.
May: Nice work, guys. The window’s open.
Quinn: Relax. Practice drills. The compound’s secure. You have nothing to worry about.
Jacobs: Tell us what the hell is going on out there, or you can kiss a government contract goodbye.
Quinn: G-gentlemen, gentlemen, please, I beg you…
Garrett: Don’t beg them, Quinn. You’re not a rottweiler. We don’t need their scraps.
Jacobs: Who the hell is this?
Quinn: This is our strategy consultant, John Garrett.
Jacobs: I want full disclosure right now, or our boys will come in and shut you down. Why do I hear gunfire?
Garrett: You hear the dying breath of an old world, general, and a new world is coming. I’ve tasted it on my tongue.
Jacobs: This is your strategy consultant?
Quinn: He’s… part time.
Garrett: New strategy… you shut your mouth and give us everything we want.
Jacobs: You threaten a United States general, and there are consequences.
Garrett: Oh, you feel powerful now, don’t you? But you’re all just slaves who will serve our future.
Jacobs: Listen, you crazy son of a bitch…
Quinn: Gentlemen, perhaps a small demonstration will…
Garrett: Yes. Oh, yes. A demonstration. I’ve seen the future. I’ve glimpsed it through the eyes of every creature, dead, living, or yet to be. This is the beginning.
Ward: The beginning of what, John?
Garrett: The end. Aah!
Ward: You’re not going anywhere. You think you can steal the gravitonium?
Raina: It was given to us.
Ward: What the hell did you say to Garrett?
Raina: I listened.
Ward: He’s psychotic! Did you notice that?! I just had to lock up six government officials because he butchered the seventh one. He completely lost it in there.
Raina: You’re wrong. Garrett’s not lost. Far from it. He’s connected now.
Ward: Don’t tell me you’re following him into this madness. His talk of evolution…
Raina: I agree with him. You’re the one who follows him. But in this case, you should. For the first time, you both need the same thing, and so do I.
Ward: What are you talking about? I need him to get his head on straight.
Raina: Skye… we need Skye, and that’s all you ever wanted, isn’t it? The evolution he speaks of… she’ll be an important part of that, so go get her, Grant Ward.
Ward: Get her for what?
Raina: The world is going to change, and when it does, she could be yours.
Ward: Wow. You really are crazy. Skye detests me. She thinks I’m a monster.
Raina: Are you? Is that your true nature, or is that what Garrett made you to be?
Ward: I don’t know.
Raina: Well, we know about Skye’s parents, about the darkness that lies inside her. I believe in a world where her true nature will reveal itself. And when that day comes, maybe you two could be monsters together.
Coulson: More on our six. Here they come.
Triplett: These windows can’t take many more hits like that, sir.
Coulson: Let’s hope they don’t have to.
Skye: Coulson, we’ve found the dealer. This is a bomb. You know what those do. And you’ve seen Agent May here through the eyes of your super soldiers, so you know what she does. You don’t want to mess with us, is my point.
Zeller: You’re not gonna be able to hijack our soldiers. We’ve thought through every emergency scenario, including this one.
May: Don’t tell me you just switched the soldiers to default directive.
Zeller: Yeah, I did. And how did you know about that?
Triplett: Time for the guns?
Coulson: Time for the guns. Stay. Stay. Good boy.
Triplett: They’re off to defend Garrett.
Coulson: And lead me right to him. Now that we’re inside, go contact on forces and make some noise on the way out. Trip, if the rest of us don’t make it, I still want this place to burn.
Triplett: I prefer you make it, sir.
Coulson: Me, too.
Ward: The compound’s been hit. Raina and Quinn took off. We need to take action now. What are my orders?
Garrett: That’s up to you, son.
Ward: Wake up! Come back to reality, John. What do you need me to do?
Garrett: You’ve already done it. Oh. It’s your handler, probably to tell me what the soldiers are seeing. Yeah?
Skye: Hi, John. Just calling to catch up.
Garrett: Skye. You sound different on the phone… huskier.
Skye: You curious why I’m calling from your soldier control center?
Garrett: No, I’m not too concerned. You see, if anyone but the assigned handler gives a directive to one of my men, well, kaboom.
Skye: Ah, darn it. Coulson didn’t think of that. You outsmarted us again.
Garrett: Phil’s around? Great. We actually have a lot to talk about. Oh, and I wanted you to know… your scientist friends… they were brave until their last breath. Raina told me how special Skye is. I know you’ve seen that from the start. You want orders? Get her.
Ward: Thank you.
Garrett: He’s always been a tender heart. You don’t need to be set to default. You haven’t left me alone all day.
Mike: I was told to never leave your side, sir.
Garrett: I love you, too.
Fitz: All right, we need to hurry. We have to do this soon. There has to be enough ox…
Simmons: Oxygen to ignite, yes.
Fitz: Yeah. Okay. Now, when I press that power button…
Simmons: The window will blow in, and water will rush inwards.
Fitz: Yeah, which is gonna be like 100 punches to the stomach, okay? The wind’s gonna be knocked right out of us. Now, this is near empty, but I’ve rigged it to let out a burst of very high pressure… should force a breath into your lungs, but you have to hold on to it, okay? Hold on tight. Should be enough to get you up the 90 feet or so.
Simmons: One breath? But there’s two of us.
Fitz: Yeah, I’ve done the math. That’s why you’re taking it. You’re a better swimmer, anyway.
Simmons: No.
Fitz: Jemma.
Simmons: No! I’m not leaving you here. That’s ridiculous. We need a new plan.
Fitz: We’re not discussing it, okay? You’re taking it, end of story. I couldn’t live if you didn’t.
Simmons: Well, I feel the same way. There has to be another way.
Fitz: You’re taking it.
Simmons: Why? Why would you make me do this? You’re my best friend in the world!
Fitz: Yeah, and you’re more than that, Jemma. I couldn’t find the courage to tell you. So, please… let me show you. It’s okay.
Simmons: No. No.
Fitz: Jemma. Jemma. Jemma. Jemma, we have to hurry.
Simmons: No. No.
Fitz: Take it, Jemma. Take it.
Simmons: No. Nooo!
Simmons: Help!
Fury: You’re in decompression on a jet back to the mainland.
Simmons: They told us you were dead.
Fury: Good. We want word to get around on that.
Simmons: Fitz!
Fury: Uh, easy. Easy. His heart’s still beating… just barely. I have a full med team with him. But you have to remain in this chamber, okay? His brain was without oxygen for a long time, but you saved him.
Simmons: It was the other way around. How did you find us?
Fury: That makeshift beacon of yours… good thinking. Led us right to you. Lucky we were looking.
Simmons: You were looking?
Fury: For my man Coulson. I understand you’re involved in a dispute I might want to weigh in on. Do you have anything that might lead me to him?
Skye: Looks like the back entrance to the factory floor is on the South side.
Coulson: Roger that.
Skye: I have to hit “snooze” on this every minute to keep that from blowing.
Zeller: Look, I will die before talking, but there’s nothing to tell. There’s no way of controlling the soldiers unless there’s an actual handler at the machine.
Skye: I’m not interested in that. I’m more interested in why you’re willing to die for Hydra. Are you a true believer? Is Hydra the plucky little family you never had? Or are you here because of the Incentives program?
Ward: She’s not gonna kill you. She had a chance to kill me before and couldn’t do it. And she hates me… a lot.
Skye: I feel sorry for you… betraying the only people who gave you a chance at being a decent human being. Fitz was a hero because he still wanted to give you that chance after everything. But some people are just born evil, I guess.
Ward: Yeah. Yeah, maybe they are. I’ve learned things about you, Skye… history… things you’ll want to know. You and I aren’t that different.
Skye: You’re not the evil I was referring to. Garrett is evil. You’re just… weak, doing anything you’re told. I hope Garrett orders you to walk into traffic.
Ward: You’re right, Skye. You woke up a weakness inside me. And for the first time in a while, I wanted something for myself. Maybe I’ll just take what I want… wake up something inside of you.
Skye: I’m not afraid of you, Ward.
Ward: Nah. You’re not gonna kill us with the bomb. You’d go, too.
Skye: No. I have a weapon much better than a bomb that will absolutely destroy you.
Ward: And why’s that?
Skye: Because you slept with her, and she’s really pissed off.
Skye: Let’s talk about Incentives.
Zeller: What you…
Ward: You said our thing was no strings attached. Looks to me like the ice queen got her feelings hurt.
Man: Hey-ho, friends! The enemy approaches.
Garrett: Check the perimeter.
Man: Careful, now, or they’ll win the day.
Coulson: Hi, John.
Garrett: Hi, Phil.
Coulson: Well, that’s new. Sir?
Fury: You don’t have to call me “sir,” Coulson. Look at me. I’m dressed like I live under a bridge.
Coulson: What are you doing here?
Fury: Well, Simmons turned me on to that old-timey tracker Fitz left on your bus. I went to great pains to make sure you didn’t die the first time.
Coulson: Well, now’s probably not the best time, but… I’d like to have a lengthy conversation with you about that. It might get loud.
Fury: And I owe you that. But right now, we owe Garrett a punch in the teeth, wouldn’t you say? This… packs a pretty good punch.
Coulson: I know what it does.
Ward: Reminds me of the old days.
May: You were never on top.
Skye: We are running out of time. Tell the man what they have on you.
Garrett: Fury. Well, hell… when was the last time anyone saw a tag-team wrestling match with four dead guys?
Coulson: I only see one dead guy in here.
Garrett: Oh, the power’s all on this side of the room, fellas. Phil, I’m surprised you’d try and stop me. Of course, I don’t blame you, Nick. You haven’t seen the big picture, the big bang, the timeless frozen ocean, but Phil here has. We share a bond. We’re blood brothers.
Fury: You didn’t tell me he’d gone this crazy.
Coulson: He’s really stepped it up a notch.
May: Aah!
Ward: Aah! Aah! Wait, May!
May: I think I’ve waited long enough for this.
Woman: Kyle?
Zeller: Oh, baby. I’m so sorry what they did to you. What are you looking for?
Skye: Our ace in the hole.
Garrett: You remember that speech you used to give us, Nick, about how one man can accomplish anything once he realizes he can be something bigger? Well, now I am.
Fury: A part… a part of something bigger.
Garrett: Is that how it went?
Coulson: Not a great listener.
Fury: If you tell me this whole Hydra path thing you took is because you misheard my damn “one man” speech…
Garrett: I am the key to the future of the universe. I’m the origin of all things.
Fury: You got it, right?
Coulson: Totally. Loud and clear.
Zeller: No, come on, please, I… Aww, man.
Skye: Here. Okay, Ace, I need you to give me a message, okay? Something your father would know could only come from you. I need to prove I have you.
Zeller: It won’t matter. I’ve already told you… there’s no way to communicate with Deathlok from in here.
Skye: I don’t need to. I’ve been communicating with him the whole time.
Coulson: Fury was teaching us something you didn’t want to hear, John, ‘cause you only think about yourself. That’s the difference between your side and our side and why we’re always gonna win.
Garrett: What lesson, Phil? Please, enlighten me.
Garrett: You can’t do this, Mike. I order you to stand down! You must obey me! You need me to translate the words of creation. You don’t want to do this, Mike. Tell him, Phil!
Coulson: Mr. Peterson’s free to do whatever he wants.
Mike: Raah!
Fury: You think he learned his lesson?
Coulson: He learned something.
Coulson: Without regular injections, they’re just men. Once doctors remove their cybernetic eyes, they’ll be essentially back to normal.
Triplett: Minus an eye, of course.
Coulson: You got a chance to express all your feelings?
May: Is he still breathing?
Coulson: Guess she kept some of it to herself.
May: He’s having trouble speaking. I think I fractured his larynx.
Coulson: Oh, good. Your attempt to cross off Fitz and Simmons failed, but Fitz may never be the same again. So I’m going to invent new ways to ruin the rest of your life. And we’ll do whatever’s necessary to get Hydra intel from you, but your torture… that’s gonna be internal.
May: And a little bit external.
Coulson: Sure. Some of that. But you devoted your entire life to a deranged narcissist who never gave a damn about anyone, and now he’s dead. You’ve got the rest of your life to wrestle with the question… who are you without him?
Skye: Why don’t you go to him?
Mike: I don’t want him to see what I’ve become.
Skye: He won’t care about your burns.
Mike: That’s not what I mean.
Skye: Coulson said to bring you in.
Mike: You can access my hardware and watch my every move. Go ahead. I’ll only be making amends for my actions.
Skye: Whatever you did, you did it for Ace.
Mike: And what I do now? That’ll be for him, too.
Garrett: There’s a reason why they say, “cut off the head.” Now I’ll be unstop…
Coulson: Hey, guys! I found it! Told you it’d be in here.
Coulson: Stupid, stupid, stupid, and cruel, and very stupid!
Fury: I think you’ve made your point.
Coulson: Why bring me back in the first place? Clearly, I didn’t think it was the best idea. I warned you about people losing their minds.
Fury: Agent May was on top of the situation. She says you’re fine. Aren’t you? It was a “break glass in case of emergency” situation.
Coulson: Yes, but that emergency was supposed to be the fall of an Avenger.
Fury: Exactly. And I’m damn glad I did it, too. When you want to build something, you need a strong foundation. Now, you know how few people I trust, Coulson.
Coulson: You can count them on one hand.
Fury: And I’m not afraid to cut off fingers. The principle S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded upon was pure.
May: Protection.
Fury: Protection… one word. Sometimes, to protect one man against himself… other times, to protect the planet against an alien invasion from another universe. It’s a broad job description.
Coulson: No need to tell me.
Fury: But the belief that drives us all is the same, whether it’s one man or all mankind.
Coulson: That they’re worth saving.
Fury: That truth lives inside you, Coulson. Before it was torn apart, S.H.I.E.L.D. was a lot of moving parts. Guys like you were the heart. Now… you’ll be the head.
Coulson: What is it?
Fury: A toolbox to help you build it back up.
Coulson: You want me to start over, rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D…
Fury: From scratch. Take your time and do it right. You’ll still have his back.
May: Of course.
Fury: There’s no one else I trust with this.
Coulson: Thank you, sir. How do you… how should I proceed?
Fury: That’s up to you… Director.
May: And you, sir… where are you heading now?
Fury: Well, I’m trading in my bird’s-eye view for two solid feet on the ground. This is the last time you’ll be seeing me for a stretch.
Coulson: You’re gonna disappear, nowhere to be found.
Fury: Nowhere? You know me better than that, Phil. I’ll be everywhere.
Skye: Fitz… is he okay? Please tell me he’s okay.
Simmons: He’s alive.
May: What is this place?
Coulson: First thing I found in that box was these coordinates. Another secret base?
Billy: I call it the Playground, although, technically, it doesn’t have a name because, technically, it doesn’t exist, it being a secret base and all.
Skye: Eric?
Billy: Billy… Koenig, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., although I totally understand the confusion. Eric passed away, sadly, but it’s great to have company, finally, and I did not mind minding this place.
Coulson: Agent Coulson.
Billy: I know. I know. And it is an honor to meet you, sir! I’ll get your lanyard shortly. For the rest of you, lanyards will be handed out on a case-by-case basis. Can’t be too careful with all those Hydra threats still out there, causing trouble. That’s why we’re here… get you up and running and back fighting the good fight, which is gonna be cool. I know we don’t have much, but what we have is yours, sir.
Coulson: Thank you.
Billy: So… where would you like to start?
Raina: I know you thought you’d never see me again, but… I found your daughter.
