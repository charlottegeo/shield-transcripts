Woman: Then at last, to be told there’s no hope. I’m not to see.
Man: Don’t say that. You’re going to see with my eyes.
Woman: That’s why I’m here.
Man: Listen, you called me “friend” once. Will you let me think you meant it? Will you let me be hands and eyes to you? Because I’ve nothing else to do the whole rest of my life but help you see whatever you want to see.
Karla: Yes?
Cal: Is this Karla Faye Gideon? Got your name off the gifted index.
Karla: Um, I’m… I’m sorry. Are you with S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Cal: I’ll try not to be offended. We are absolutely not from S.H.I.E.L.D. Show her. Levi, an old buddy of mine. Genius. S.H.I.E.L.D. implanted a chip in his arm. Couldn’t get within 100 feet of any tech. I found him holed up in an RV in the Mojave. But now, sans chip, this guy manages to decrypt the index for me. Led me to Francis. Three years, they kept him in a cage. Meds to keep him docile. I know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to you. How long has it been since you touched someone, since you felt a sensation on your fingertips? We want to free you from these shackles. All you got to do is say that you…
Cal: Feels good, doesn’t it? Freedom.
Karla: Mm.
Cal: Don’t you think it’s time everyone learn how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats people like us? We’re gonna teach them a lesson, and we want you to join us. I know. I sound bat-guano crazy. Except S.H.I.E.L.D. Nah. Not so mighty anymore. A handful of agents. Director is a door-to-door salesman of a man.
Karla: Still, I’m… I’m not powerful myself.
Cal: None of us are. But together, we’re a force. What do you say?
Karla: I’m in.
Skye: Mmm. I got to say, Director, no doubt, the best grilled cheese I’ve ever had.
Coulson: Secret ingredient. Don’t ask. I will not disclose. How you doing with all the monitoring?
Skye: I barely notice it.
Coulson: We wouldn’t subject you to it if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.
Skye: I assume you’re putting me on the gifted index.
Coulson: We are.
Skye: I’ve been doing some monitoring of my own. Check this out. My entire life, I’ve been searching for my parents, and my search ended with answers that are so much worse than I could have imagined. Sad, twitchy, not-all-there dad, a dead mom, alien mist that turned me into a walking natural disaster, a friend dead…
Coulson: Hey. Trip was not your fault.
Skye: My point is, I’m steady. Nothing is shaking. I’m stopping them before they start.
Coulson: That’s good.
Skye: If I keep working on this, I can be back in the field in no time.
Coulson: She’s acting like everything will go back to normal.
May: That’s what she does. Does she know we’re putting her on the index?
Coulson: Yeah. She does seem to be getting control of the powers.
May: That’s good, but we barely understand them… other than they’re strong.
Coulson: Catastrophically so.
May: Protocol is anyone on the index undergoes a full psych eval and threat assessment.
Coulson: We’d need to bring in someone from outside.
May: Someone we can trust.
Coulson: I know who I’d call… if it weren’t a thing.
May: Andrew? It’s not a thing. He might say no.
Coulson: Reach out. See what he says.
Morse: Wonder where she’s off to.
Simmons: Another question in the long list of questions I don’t have answers to.
Morse: What is it?
Simmons: Coulson asked me to complete Skye’s index file to the best of my ability. I’m afraid my best is woefully insufficient.
Morse: It’s bizarre, the extra macromolecules.
Simmons: Raina’s DNA is the same. The mist triggered something inside them, something waiting to be activated. But how Skye is able to…
Fitz: Sorry. I’m just, um, looking for… Ah. Got it.
Simmons: …able to create a vibrational force? That I don’t understand at all.
Morse: How long are you gonna give him…?
Simmons: He lied to me.
Morse: We’re spies. We lie for a living. Fitz’s intentions were good. He wanted to protect a friend.
Simmons: From me? And how is that protecting her? Corrupting data, altering test results? Fitz and I shared science. It was sacred. Now that’s changed, too. I have to accept that he’s different now and our relationship won’t ever be what it was.
Morse: Little early to sound the funeral bells, don’t you think?
Simmons: A betrayal of trust like that, it changes everything.
Morse: Where are you now?
Mack: I just made it to the nearest safe house.
Morse: This is such a mess.
Mack: Yeah, a mess I didn’t make, but I’m cleaning it up the best way I can. I wasn’t gonna let him expose us.
Morse: No, I-I know.
Mack: All right, so what now, Bobbi?
Hunter: Mack, are you talking to Bobbi? Tell her I take it all back. All the “don’t die out there…”
Mack: Sorry.
Hunter:  I’d be better off if she had died out… Hope she rots in hell!
Morse: I never wanted this.
Mack: No one did. But I got no exit strategy, and the longer I’m gone, the more questions Coulson’s gonna have.
Morse: We’ll bring him in. Sit tight. I’ll arrange an extraction.
Mack: And you know where I’ll be.
Morse: And, Mack, get him a beer or something.
Andrew: Well, there’s no substitute for actually spending time with a patient. You just can’t get around it.
Student: What about the new software to track emotional health?
Andrew: Software won’t anticipate a manson or a Bin Laden. The human mind is infinitely complicated. It’s messy and… and surprising. Well, if you’ll excuse me.
Student: Thank you.
Andrew: Long time.
May: Yeah. S.H.I.E.L.D. needs your help.
Andrew: I haven’t worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. in a long while. I moved on for a reason.
May: It’s a different S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson’s the director now.
Andrew: Okay. Why me? Is, uh, Skye that bad?
May: She’s that good. Good agent. I’m her S.O.
Andrew: You’re back in the field?
May: So, what do you think?
Andrew: What do I think? I think… What the hell, Melinda? You show up asking for a favor, but when I called you after S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed to check if you were all right, not a word.
May: It was a busy time.
Andrew: “Busy.” Yeah, all right. Well… thanks for the apology. If I do this… I have conditions. No observation, no monitoring, other than what’s deemed medically necessary. My sessions with her are in private. My evaluation won’t be. She gets a copy. My duty is to her, not S.H.I.E.L.D.
May: Like I said, it’s a different S.H.I.E.L.D.
Andrew: My consultation fee’s gone up.
May: I should have called you back.
Andrew: Nah, I talked to your mom. Huh. She told me you were alive. We had a nice talk. She invited me over for dinner, and…
May: I’m not surprised. She still hasn’t forgiven me for divorcing you.
Cal: Excuse me, sir. You know, we… we must have made a wrong turn back there. I think we’re lost.
Man: Where are you trying to get to?
Cal: Uh, well, w…
Karla: Hi!
Cal: Francis, would you be so kind as to let us in?
Coulson: Dr. Garner, good to see you again. I appreciate you coming back to help.
Andrew: Congrats on the promotion. Or should I offer my condolences?
Coulson: That depends on what’s on the other end of this call. Agent Broyles. Never good to hear from you.
Coulson: Just been informed of a break-in at Brynmore psychiatric facility.
Morse: Heard of it. Houses criminally insane types. Federal facility.
Coulson: Except for the secret sub-basement under the North wing. We run that. Mentally unstable people on the index are housed there.
Morse: Is that who they’re after?
Coulson: That’s what we’re going to find out.
Morse: I’ll prep the Quinjet.
Coulson: Agent Morse, Hunter didn’t report in today. I offered him a permanent job. You think that has anything to do with his disappearance?
Morse: “Permanent” isn’t really Hunter’s thing. Even the word.
Coulson: Didn’t think he scared so easily. Well… Okay. I’ll meet you down there.
Simmons: I’m so glad you’re here, especially since it’s been well documented that powers can lead to psychological volatility. Not that Skye’s showing any signs. Her vitals currently are steady.
Andrew: May I?
Simmons: Oh, yeah.
Fitz: I did not know that you were married.
May: Now you do.
Fitz: He seems nice. Okay.
Simmons: So, it might be wise to do a pharmacological evaluation. Dulling her emotions could lessen the destructiveness of her powers… a-a stopgap measure.
Andrew: Should probably meet her before writing a prescription.
May: I’ll take you to her.
Andrew: I appreciate the extensive and thorough debrief, Agent Simmons.
Simmons: My pleasure.
May: Let me talk to her first. Skye might have a… reaction.
Skye: You’re kidding, right? A shrink?
May: It’s not personal.
Skye: Hell, it’s not personal. It’s a shrink.
May: It’s standard procedure for anyo…
Skye: No, I know, but I’m not just on the index. I’m also an agent.
May: Exactly. So you know it’s non-negotiable. Andrew is good, and he’s done this before.
Skye: So have I. I grew up in the system. I’ve been through enough of these to know that I hate them.
May: You’ll like this one.
Skye: Yeah, how do you know that?
May: Because I was married to him.
Skye: Tell me about the wedding. I’m thinking May could go either way… understated or full bridezilla. She can be a control freak.
Andrew: I’m not here to discuss my ex.
Skye: Did you guys have actual conversations? You know, like, pillow talk, or was it just pillow stern looks?
Andrew: How long are you going to deflect?
Skye: Barely in, and out comes the psychobabble.
Andrew: It’s not psychobabble. It’s just a word that describes what you’re doing. Well, I read your history. I know this isn’t your first rodeo.
Skye: Speaking of… the Cavalry. you must know what really…
Andrew: Stop.
Skye: The tone… something you both have in common.
Andrew: Hmm. Why did you shoot yourself?
Skye: It wasn’t like that. I mean, it was an ICER. I’m not suicidal.
Andrew: No, I didn’t say you were, but it’s an aggressive move.
Skye: I did what I had to do to protect my team.
Andrew: Of course. You’re an agent. And I imagine you must be afraid that you’re gonna lose that. Um… we eloped. We didn’t want a big wedding. And, no, it wasn’t Vegas. Although Melinda does love Vegas.
Skye: I also shot myself because I… I couldn’t stop what I was doing.
Andrew: How does it feel… when it’s happening?
Skye: It’s terrifying.
Broyles: Notified County, they’re gonna send us additional peronnel.
Coulson: Thank you, Agent Broyles. So, when the communications and electrical systems were fried, a group used the chaos to tear through the facility, opening doors, releasing prisoners.
Morse: Yeah, whoever did this did some serious damage to the system. I’m recovering what was recorded before the power went out. Is that Skye’s dad?
Coulson: Oh, no.
Morse: Who’s he waving to?
Coulson: Us. We have to get into that sub-level basement, now.
Morse: So, how many prisoners were housed here?
Coulson: Two. John Bruno… military assassin. Became an obsession discovering creative ways to kill.
Morse: Charming.
Coulson: Not as scary, however, as bachelor number two. He…
Man: You shouldn’t have come down here.
Coulson: Damn. Now, where’s bachelor number two? David A. Angar… vocal cords exposed to experimental energy blasts. Shrunk the tumors, but left him with a voice that triggers the central nervous system, induces immediate catatonia with the slightest whisper. Here’s his room.
Morse: Any idea what that means?
Coulson: Other than Skye’s father being crazy? Nope.
Karla: Thought we were going after S.H.I.E.L.D.
Cal: They’ll come to us.
May: Single or double?
Andrew: Seriously?
May: If I were to ask you what’s going on, you wouldn’t tell me, right?
Andrew: I told her we eloped.
May: Ah. A little gossip won you some points.
Andrew: I appreciate you giving me permission to disclose details when necessary.
May: Mm-hmm.
Andrew: She thinks the world of you.
May: I taught her how to fire an automatic. Of course she likes me.
Andrew: Seeing anyone? Mm. All work and no play.
May: When I multitask, I make mistakes.
Andrew: Hmm. Sounds like there’s a story there.
May: I saw a frame on your desk. Girlfriend pics? Aren’t you a little too old for that?
Andrew: Well… You tell me about your mistake, and I’ll tell you about it.
May: I don’t care that much.
Andrew: You look good.
May: You hungry? I can fix you something.
Andrew: I’m not that hungry.
Fitz: Won’t stay long. Just need to use the microwave. I didn’t want to disturb May and her ex.
Simmons: Disturb them from…
Fitz: In the kitchen, talking.
Simmons: Oh. What are they talking about? Is it about, um, Skye’s condition?
Fitz: No, it was, uh, personal in nature. Seems that… May isn’t a good cook.
Simmons: Something Agent May doesn’t excel at. Interesting.
Fitz: Yeah. He… He teased her about it. And she was laughing.
Simmons: Oh, he makes her laugh. Clearly, she still likes him, and have you seen the way he looks at her?
Fitz: Yeah, I have eyes, Jemma. Of course I’ve seen.
Simmons: I wonder what happened between them, why it ended.
Fitz: Yeah, they’re a bizarre pair. He listens for a living, and she doesn’t speak.
Simmons: True, but you know what they say about opposites. Perhaps spending time together could rekindle some… It’s Skye! Get May and Dr. Garner now!
May: Damn it, Skye!
Andrew: Skye, you need to wake up. Skye!
May: You’re doing this. You’re shaking the room. You need to stop.
Skye: Okay. Okay.
Simmons: If she needs a sedative…
Fitz: No, no. It’s good. It’s good. It’s stopping.
Andrew: I’m gonna stay.
May: Come on. Everybody out.
Morse:: If the RV passes a traffic cam or toll booth, we’ll find them. At least we know who we’re looking for.
Coulson: Uh, well, sometimes ignorance is bless. Wendell Levi… genius-level IQ, but no moral compass or regard for human life.
Morse: Prefer my criminals stupid.
Coulson: Well, then you’ll really like Francis Noche. Noche was a mob enforcer who wanted to be better at enforcing, so he got his hands on some experimental steroids. Left him incredibly strong. Brains? Not so much.
Morse: Mm, god doesn’t give with both hands. Sir, these people are on the index, but they’re not exactly gifted.
Coulson: They were considered highly dangerous. A larger part of the index functions as more of a watch list.
Morse: Karla Faye Gideon… razors permanently grafted into her fingers?
Coulson: Worked in a medical lab with her abusive boyfriend… wanted to protect herself.
Morse: It’s like a lifetime movie.
Coulson: I know. And I’d feel bad for her except her boyfriend wasn’t her only victim.
Morse: You’re sure Skye’s father’s the ringleader?
Coulson: Without a doubt. “Fight on.” Could be a call to arms. Maybe he wants to wage war on us, but where?
Cal: You ought to try the sausage biscuits.
Levi: I don’t like food.
Cal: You’re an interesting fellow.
Karla: Maybe it would make more sense just to forget about S.H.I.E.L.D. M-Move on. I mean, haven’t they robbed us of enough?
Cal: That’s the point. We can’t forget. We can’t just slink away and let them take from us. From me! They took my little girl. They stole her from me, and they still have her. She isn’t safe there. Losing a child, it… it tears you apart! I’m just like you. I wasn’t strong. I couldn’t protect the people I loved. So I tried to change, improve myself, with chemistry. Results were… inconsistent. Some volatility issues. But I keep working on a formula. Always tweaking. We can’t stop now. We can’t let them make us afraid or make the world afraid of us! They are the criminals, and we’re gonna shine a light on that!
Coulson: The reason Hunter left wasn’t the job offer, was it?
Morse: Excuse me?
Coulson: You’re a hard person to read, but Hunter isn’t. How long have you two been sleeping together?
Morse: I should have reported the change in our relationship, but is this the right time to discuss this?
Coulson: If we were making any headway, I’d say no, but we’re stuck. And when I’m stuck, it helps to do something else… listen to music, twirl a baton, talk about something else. They say your subconscious keeps working the problem. So… Hunter.
Morse: I broke it off. Hunter slipped back into his old patterns, which involves bailing and beer. Mack’s gone to find him, and history repeats itself.
Coulson: “History.” Oh, my god. “Fight on.”
Morse: We got a hit on the license plate.
Coulson: Let me guess… in Wisconsin.
Morse: How did you know that?
May: Why Manitowoc, Wisconsin?
Coulson: I was born there. He’s trying to lure me home.
May: You need backup.
Coulson: I need backup.
Skye: Under 70.
Andrew: How are you doing that?
Skye: May taught me. You focus on a single point, let everything else become noise disappearing in the background.
Andrew: Except it doesn’t disappear. You’re pushing it aside. Which is why, when you were dreaming, The tremors started. What were you dreaming about?
Skye: I don’t remember.
Andrew: You’re seeming defensive.
Skye: Because you keep pressing.
Andrew: Because whatever you were feeling was strong enough to shake this entire plane.
Skye: Well, I don’t know, so let’s move on. How about you show me an inkblot, and I’ll tell you about my first time?
Andrew: Humor. So that’s your thing. Well, that’s an effective way to avoid thinking about how monumentally painful your life is right now.
Skye: Good pep talk. Thanks.
Andrew: Sarcasm. Same purpose… avoidance strategy.
Skye: What am I avoiding, exactly?
Andrew: The truth. That you’re different now, that you have abilities, abilities triggered by pain, and either you face that or you don’t sleep again.
Skye: I dreamed I was on mission, looking through the scope on my rifle. The next thing I knew, I was on the other side. The rifle was trained on me.
Andrew: Pretty on point… going from being an agent to a…
Skye: Yeah, to being on the index. And I know S.H.I.E.L.D.’s policy for people on the index. I have executed that policy.
Andrew: Okay. Skye, I need you to stop. Just calm down. Take a breath.
Skye: Wait. The room is shaking.
Andrew: Right. Which is why I need you to breathe.
Skye: No, this isn’t me. I’m not doing this.
May: Look, I was gonna come talk to you once I put the bus on auto.
Andrew: Talk to me… after the fact? When we’re already in the air?
May: Coulson needs backup. Plus, you were in session. I didn’t want to interrupt.
Karla: G-g-gentle. Gentle. Here. L-Let me. I think I might cry.
Cal: Hey! Not so fast. Make it count.
Mack: Dinner. Got your favorite. Hawaiian. Meat and fruit? Doesn’t really work for me.
Hunter: I thought the prisoner got to choose his last meal.
Mack: If you were supposed to be dead, you’d already be dead. Hey, look, man, I’m just doing what has to be done. Do you remember when we first met? I was working back end for Bobbi on that mission in Dubai, and you and I were stuck on a construction site sweating our asses off.
Hunter: You’re not gonna soften me with, “oh, it was the best of times,” or, “these are a few of my favorite things.” What the hell are you and Bobbi into, Mack?
Mack: You’ll know soon enough.
Hunter: If you’ve got nothing to say, why don’t you just leave? I’ll tell you what I remember, Mack. Dubai was a cover. And because I wasn’t S.H.I.E.L.D., you didn’t tell me. Lies, that’s what I remember.
Andrew: That not-talking thing you do… not okay when we were married, but definitely not okay now.
May: Not okay is Skye’s lunatic father leading Coulson into a trap. Civilians could be hurt. I acted quickly.
Andrew: And me and Skye, we do what?
May: Same as if we were on base. Stay in the cage. Continue your evaluation.
Skye: That’s so not gonna happen.
May: This is not a negotiation, Skye. You’re staying on the bus.
Skye: If Coulson needs backup…
May: He’ll have it. We don’t need you.
Skye: Yes, you do. My father’s involved. And for better or worse, I matter to him, And we can use that.
Andrew: I’m with May. This is an emotional powder keg you shouldn’t be anywhere near.
May: Right. We can’t risk you losing control.
Skye: I won’t. You don’t know that. Yes, I do. I know, because those windows aren’t shattered in a million pieces right now, because this plane isn’t coming apart. I’m feeling all of it. I’m locking it down just like you trained me to do.
Andrew: Having contact with your father is a bad idea. If you can’t control your feelings…
Skye: I’ll ice myself. Look. You put me on the index. You’re doing my intake assessment. How about we let my dad know?
Morse: Is this your high school?
Coulson: I never went here. My dad coached football and taught history.
Morse: Were you close?
Coulson: I was 9 when he died. I’ve forgotten more about him than I remember. Angar.
Cal: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome you to this historic matchup between the S.H.I.E.L.D. Eagles and us, rivals and underdogs, the… Slicing… Talons? Tonight’s game is being simulcast live over A.M. 520… W.A.S.Y., your local sports radio.
Morse: What’s he doing?
Coulson: Making a statement, a public one.
Cal: Leading off for S.H.I.E.L.D., an ugly piece of work and your native son. Let’s welcome Phil Coulson to the field.
Coulson: Five of them, two of us, we wait for May.
Cal: Here’s a fun fact. He killed the man I had been plotting to kill for two and a half decades! Disappointment! Come out, come out, wherever you are. We’re waiting. You’re seeming rude, Phil. Ungrateful. We went to all this trouble. You see, we got these kids here, these kids with their whole lives in front of them. Aren’t you gonna help? Hmm? Or have I misjudged you, Phil? Are you gonna stand by while we hurt them? Aw, Phil.
Coulson: This is between us! No one else needs to get hurt. Let them go.
Cal: They can’t go anywhere.
Coulson: What did you do?!
Cal: Took a cue from S.H.I.E.L.D. we took their potential and contained it, inhibited it like you do.
Coulson: To criminals, not cheerleaders.
Cal: You say potato… Angar. Phil’s a smart guy… would have taken precautions. Would you please check him? Thank you.
Coulson: What do you want?
Cal: We want S.H.I.E.L.D. exposed for its barbaric crimes against exceptional humanity. We want everyone to know what you do to people like us. And we want you to stop before you do it to her.
May: Talking about her?
Cal: You monster.
Coulson: May.
Cal: Daisy. What have they done to you?
May: We put her on the index. Now we decide… contain her or put her down. Your call.
Cal: Tell me they didn’t hurt you.
May: Talk to me, not her. Now, you let these people go, or your daughter dies.
Cal: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can’t lose you again. Don’t you see what they do? You’ve been changed. And it scares the hell out of them. I think it’s wonderful. I can help! So, tell me, what’s your thing? I mean, I was hoping it was wings.
May: Talk to me, not her.
Cal: You chose him. You threatened to kill me, your own father. You didn’t know any better. They raised you. They brainwashed you. You won’t kill her. Though, the truth is, you’re capable of such things. That’s what I’m trying to teach this whole damn town. I don’t even know if they’re listening. Maybe they’ll listen to you.
Karla: End this now!
Andrew: Skye.
May: Take this. Go on.
Andrew: Come on. Come on.
Morse: Karla? You should turn yourself in.
Karla: Ha! I already tried that. No, thanks.
Levi: No! Don’t! Please! Don’t…
Cal: Daisy, what have they done to you?
Simmons: You’re awake. You’re probably feeling a little drowsy. We gave you something to help you sleep.
Skye: Why do I have these bruises?
Simmons: I ran some tests. The bruising was caused by capillary ruptures in your arms. X-rays showed more than 75 hairline fractures from your clavicle to your fingers.
Skye: I… I don’t understand.
Andrew: You weren’t stopping your powers, Skye. You were… directing them inward.
Skye: What am I supposed to do?
Simmons: I made the casts from compression microfibers to help contain the shaking, minimize the damage.
May: That’s not what she means, Simmons. We’ll figure this out, Skye.
Coulson: What do you mean, “other?”
Simmons: “Gifted” is both insufficient and too broad. I believe there are two categories we’re dealing with. Um, “enhanced” is what I would suggest we call people like David Angar, Mike Peterson… people whose gifts were man-made. Skye, Raina… this was inside them, a part of them.
Coulson: We need to understand more about their powers, especially how to stop them in case that becomes necessary. This is a priority, Agent Simmons.
Simmons: Understood, sir.
Coulson: And, Agent Simmons… keep this between us. Don’t bring anyone else in.
Simmons: Yes, sir.
Andrew: I left Coulson and Skye copies of my report.
May: I assume you’re recommending Skye be removed from active duty.
Andrew: I’m recommending Skye leave S.H.I.E.L.D. altogether. It’s too much for her to deal with, emotionally, physically. She needs to be somewhere safe to do that.
May: She is safe with us.
Andrew: You really believe that? After Bahrain? You better than anyone knows how badly this can end.
May: We’re as close to a family as Skye has.
Andrew: Yeah.
May: She likes you. Would you consider consulting for us?
Andrew: No. I can suggest someone, but it can’t be me. S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn’t changed. None of it’s changed. There was a reason I moved on back then. And I have another reason now. Her photo’s on my desk. Goodbye, Melinda.
Mack: Our ride’s here. Let’s go.
Mack: You were right. For a while there, it all went to hell. It was bad. But now Bobbi and I work for an organization, an outlier that came out of the wreckage from what Fury left.
Hunter: What organization, Mack? Who the hell are you working for?
Mack: S.H.I.E.L.D. The real S.H.I.E.L.D.
Gordon: You done yet?
Cal: Why didn’t you take Daisy? Why?! She needs you. She needs to be away from those animals that have her.
Gordon: What we do is none of your concern.
Cal: Then why am I here?
Gordon: Because you’re making too much noise.
Cal: Noise? I’m sounding a battle cry! I’m protecting us from S.H.I.E.L.D.
Gordon: There is no “us.” You’re not one of us. You’re a science experiment.
Cal: So what happens to me, then?
Gordon: That’s not for me to decide.
