Cal:  This won’t hold me for long, Phil.
Coulson: It’ll hold you long enough. The hangar’s been emptied, locked down. [sighs] It’s just us, Cal, to have a little chat.
Cal: When I get free, I will rip your voice box out of your throat!
Coulson: And try to come to our senses. Either we walk out of here together, or not at all. You got it? We both want the same thing.
Cal: What I want is to snap your spine like celery.
Coulson: See, I don’t think you really do.
Cal: Well, let’s test your hypothesis.
Coulson: Oh, I think you’re willing to, but want is a different thing. What we both want is to protect your daughter. You’re a family man.
Cal: Who is sick of you sticking your nose in our business.
Coulson: It was your devotion to them that made you willing to do those terrible things all those years ago, wasn’t it?
Cal: Shut up.
Coulson: Nightmarish acts of violence that you didn’t want to commit, did you? Your wife made you do it.
Cal: You don’t know her! You don’t know anything! Say one more word, and I’ll…
Coulson: I’m not saying your wife is a monster, Cal. I think you already know she’s a monster. What I’m saying is you’re not. I know you’ve thought so for a long time. But deep down, you’re a good man. I believe that. I do. You got a big heart full of love.
Cal: Stop.
Coulson: You wear it on your sleeve. Skye got that from you.
Cal: No.
Coulson: That’s right.
Cal: No, stop! Stop!
Coulson: You were just trying to save her, trying to please your wife.
Cal: No, I was trying to put my family back together! I… I reassembled her, piece by piece, sewed her back up, but she was never the same.
Coulson: She was out for blood.
Cal: Before Whitehall, an elder would sacrifice themselves every few decades so she could live on, carry on tradition. She would weep, scream, beg them not to. She had a good heart, Phil. She did. It was just torn out. And she needs to take lives to heal.
Coulson: So you supplied them.
Cal: Yes, a village of them. But it was never enough. She didn’t care about human life anymore. Even I had to change myself to be worthy in her eyes. I thought I could fix her if I could just make good on my promise. I promised to protect our daughter.
Coulson: Does that include protecting your daughter from her? You know Skye now, her compassion. Jiaying’s out for blood, and there’s no way in hell Skye will go along with that. Think about the danger that puts her in. She’s not my daughter, but she’s as close to family as I’ve got, and I will save her, no matter what the cost.
Cal: Please, let me help you.
Skye: You want to lend me a hand getting these things off? Or a face? Mack? Thank god. Who’s with you?
Mack: Just you and me, tremors. Your people just took over the ship. About 100 or so prisoners. The rest are dead. Guess they’re not as harmless as you say.
Skye: I swear, I never meant for any of this to happen. I…
Mack: Well, we need to stop them. But if you’re in here, I’m guessing you figured that out already.
Skye: It’s my mother. She’s manipulating them. Not all of these people are bad.
Mack: They’re using their powers to kill S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, so I don’t give a damn about intentions right now. I came here because I need your skills.
Skye: I can’t use my powers. They locked these inhibitors on me.
Mack: Not the skills I’m looking for. Heard you have a history of hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D.
Man: That’s the fan room, down on the fourth deck. All the ship’s air circulates through it.
Jiaying: Take a case of crystals down there. Load the rest on the Quinjet.
Lincoln: We have a problem. I disabled the communication systems, but an emergency beacon was sent out to Coulson’s base. It’s hard-wired, and there’s no way to cancel it without the proper code.
Jiaying: Do one of you have the code?
Weaver: I suggest you surrender peacefully. When Coulson gets the message, he’ll come at you with everything he has.
Jiaying: Coulson’s being dealt with. I don’t need you to cancel the beacon. I want you to expand it. This ship and Coulson’s base aren’t the full extent of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s operations. Expand the beacon. Invite them all.
Lincoln: You want them to know we’re here?
Jiaying: We have to show them what we’re capable of. It’s the only way they’ll ever leave us alone.
Oliver: We don’t know what you’re planning, but we’ll play no part in it. Hands off, you freak!
Weaver: What are you doing? Let him go!
Jiaying: Do you like rare gems?
Weaver: You don’t think you can bribe me.
Jiaying: It’s not a bribe. It’s an incentive.
Jiaying: Expand the beacon, or there will be more.
Mack: If we don’t cut that beacon, it’ll bring every available agent racing here.
Skye: And she plans to do that to all of them.
Mack: The problem is, it’s hard-wired, clear on the other side of the ship, with a dozen ginger ninjas and god knows who else standing in the way.
Skye: But we’re still gonna try.
Mack: Hell yeah.
Simmons: Well, his physical changes have improved.
Cal: Careful. I’m a married man. Sorry, Phil. This looks expensive.
Coulson: We have a tab running.
Fitz: Sir, the carrier’s distress call, it’s expanded to all channels.
Coulson: Jiaying used Cal’s distraction to take over that ship in minutes.
Fitz: Yeah. It’s intimidating.
Coulson: You get May and Hunter on the line? We’ll need every asset we’ve got to shut these Inhumans down.
Fitz: I tried, sir. Uh, their team’s already gone dark.
Ward: There he is, poor sap, not a clue what he’s walking into.
Kara: I didn’t think May would be with him. She could screw the whole thing up for us.
Ward: Well, we’ll make sure Hunter and Bobbi get their reunion by taking the rest out one by one. Don’t worry about May. I’ll take care of her. I owe her that.
Hunter: Take that all the way. Check every room. Bob? Bobbi? Bob? I’m coming to find you, Bob.
Hunter: Bobbi.
Agent: Agent May?
Kara: Not really.
May: Agent Walker took the South corner, right? He still radio silent? All agents converge on the South corner. I’ll meet you there. Do not lower your guard until you see my face.
Agent: Hunter’s the only agent left.
May: She doesn’t know that.
Hunter: Bobbi. I’m coming for you, Bob.
Hunter: Bob! Come on! Stay with me, Bob! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Bob. Bob, Bob. Stay with me. Stay with me. Bobbi. Bobbi. Stay with me. Please, please. I’ve got you. I’ve got you.
Kara: Baby.
Ward: No. Kara? No, no. Kara, no. Kara, look at me. Look at me! No, no, no, no! No, Kara! Look at me, baby. Come on. It’s… It’s…
Hunter: Oh, god. Oh, god. Please. Please, Bobbi. Come on. Help. We need to get her out of here! I’m losing her!
May: Easy, easy.
Gordon: Beautiful, isn’t it?
Lincoln: I don’t know about beautiful, but I’m guessing it’s dangerous.
Gordon: In the wrong hands, lethal to our people. It’s better we have control over it.
Lincoln: And what about us? How dangerous are we?
Gordon: Very. We’ve always been. Now they know it.
Lincoln: What Jiaying did in there was… that was murder.
Gordon: That was necessary. She’ll do whatever’s needed to protect our people. You know that better than most. Are you forgetting your life before we found you?
Lincoln: Of course I haven’t forgotten.
Gordon: Then you remember how far she went to save you and know how far she will go to save all of us. We’re not doing anything that S.H.I.E.L.D. itself wouldn’t do. They have turned Jiaying’s own daughter against us. We have her locked up now, but given how lethal Skye is, it could get worse. You’d be wise to remember that.
Skye: She just killed them, all of them, didn’t even think about it.
Mack: Yeah, I thought my mom was bad when she started watching Fox News.
Skye: And I fell for the whole act.
Mack: Look, you had to choose between two… This way. This way. You had to choose between two sides that both mean something. I get it. You make the best choice you can. Sometimes, it works out. Sometimes…
Skye: It didn’t.
Mack: It did not. Beacon’s in the sat room down to the left. Go get started. Try to hack the code and turn it off.
Skye: Wait. Where are you going?
Mack: To find a power saw in case you can’t.
Fitz: Sir, good news. I’ve modified my field generators to act in unison as a quantum-field disrupter.
Coulson: Great, you’re saying you found a way to shut down Gordon’s teleportation ability?
Fitz: Well, now my news sounds less good.
Coulson: Oh. Sorry.
Fitz: The disrupter should keep him contained to a single space.
Coulson: I’ll take anything. We have Quinjets flying in from all over the world right now to answer the S.O.S. with us. It will be nice to have something more to offer them than an encouraging thumbs-up.
Fitz: What about Bobbi?
Coulson: Landing any moment.
Simmons: Cal destroyed the lab. It’s unusable right now. This is our best option. We’ll make it work.
Coulson: Any update from May on Bobbi’s condition?
Simmons: They’ve slowed the bleeding. She’s holding on, but barely. Okay. We’ll see.
Coulson: And is Cal stable enough to join the mission on the carrier?
Simmons: Why would you want Cal on the mission?
Fitz: That doesn’t sound like a very good idea.
May: Gunshot wound to the upper back. Exit wound in the chest. Pulse is 140 and weak. B.P.’s 60 over 30.
Hunter: She stopped breathing just before we landed.
May: I bagged her, got her going again. Hurry.
Simmons: 1, 2, 3. Let’s get her prepped for surgery. CBC with diff, chem-20. Portable chest x-rays. Cross and type for two units.
Woman: Yes, doctor.
Lincoln: How did you get out?
Skye: Lincoln. I-I can explain.
Lincoln: Don’t bother.
Skye: You’ve got this wrong. Very wrong. Listen, please.
Lincoln: I just found you trying to reach out to your S.H.I.E.L.D. friends. You planning the next assault?
Skye: That attack didn’t happen, Lincoln. Jiaying staged the whole thing. She murdered Gonzales, then shot herself to frame S.H.I.E.L.D. so we’d follow her to war.
Lincoln: Do you even hear how crazy that sounds? Shot herself?
Skye: She’s already healed, hasn’t she? I’d tell you to ask Raina, she can see the future, but she’s not here, is she? She’s not here because she had a vision of what happened, what’s going to happen. And Jiaying couldn’t risk her talking, so she cut her throat.
Lincoln: Why are you doing this, trying to turn us against her?
Skye: You saw what she did with those crystals, killed unarmed agents. Okay, think. Why would she want the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. to come here? It’s… It’s not to hug it out. She wants to execute them. We can stop this. Please, just tell me where she took the crystals.
Lincoln: The fan room… where the ship’s air circu…
Mack: Found a saw.
Skye: I was getting through to him.
Mack: Right now, I’m in a “crack heads first, ask questions later” frame of mind. Here. Hack that beacon or just cut it. I’m gonna make sure those crystals don’t hurt anyone else.
Skye: Mack, you know what happens if one breaks near a vent, near you.
Mack: That’s why they won’t.
Andrew: Melinda?
May: I just wanted to hear your voice.
Andrew: You haven’t made a call like this since Bahrain.
May: Yeah.
Andrew: Well, then I know it’s not good. Do you want to tell me what’s going on? How bad are we talking?
May: There’s no way it will end well. Andrew, there’s a lot I didn’t say that I wish I did.
Andrew: Me, too. Do good, Melinda, and get home safe.
Simmons: You’ll be careful?
Fitz: I won’t be careful. I’ll get the job done.
Simmons: Well, w-watch your back because I just saw Hunter with Bobbi, and it made me realize that… I… well, it’s just that w… we never really spoke about… what you said to me at the bottom of the ocean.
Fitz: This? Now? You want to talk about this now?
Simmons: No. We… We don’t… uh… it means a lot to me that we’re friends again, and I, um… maybe when you get back, we could finally just talk about it.
Fitz: It’s… There’s nothing to discuss, Jemma.
Simmons: Maybe there is.
Coulson: Agent Fitz, we’re on the move.
May: I’d like to formally voice my doubts about bringing him on this mission.
Coulson: I understand your concerns, May, but Cal’s lived with the Inhumans. He knows what we’re getting ourselves into. We do not.
May: He’s a loose cannon.
Coulson: Worse comes to worst, we let the cannon loose. Any distraction might help us take that boat. Look, Cal’s erratic, but if there’s one constant, it’s his concern for Skye.
Fitz: Sir, something’s happening with the S.O.S. signal from the boat. I thought it was breaking up, like someone cutting the line.
Coulson: Radio interference?
Fitz: No, but there’s, um, uh, a pattern to it, like a code.
Coulson: It’s Skye. What’s she saying?
Fitz: That it’s a trap.
Coulson: This is SHIELD 218 ordering all other forces to fall back. Repeat. Fall back.
May: And what about us?
Coulson: We’re gonna finish this.
Man: All the S.H.I.E.L.D. jets have turned around except one.
Jiaying: Someone must have warned them. Go check Skye’s cell.
Gordon: What do you want to do with the rest of the prisoners on this ship? If S.H.I.E.L.D.’s not coming…
Jiaying: Then there’s no reason to wait. Break the crystals. Release the mist. Either they’re Inhuman or they’re dead.
Coulson: We don’t know the size of the force we’re up against, but priority one is saving the crew of the ship. Find them. Free them. May, head to operations. Take control of the ship’s functionality.
Fitz: Sir, um, Skye’s last message came through. It reads, “modified crystals lethal HVAC room.”
Coulson: Does she mean the Terrigen crystals that release the mist?
Fitz: Yeah. But “modified” and “lethal.”
May: And the HVAC room controls the ship’s ventilation.
Cal: Ah! So that’s what this little mutiny’s all about. Gas them all. See what shakes loose.
Coulson: Not if I get to her first.
Cal: Oh, no, no. Not you, Phil. This is a family matter. My wife, my responsibility. You just find those crystals and leave her to me.
May: You brought him.
Coulson: All right, everybody.
Mack: It’s Gordon, right?
Gordon: And you are?
Mack: I’m the guy who kills Gordon.
Jiaying: I want you to remain behind. Gather anyone who makes it through the mist alive.
Skye: What are you doing with those?
Jiaying: What I’ve always done. There are descendants everywhere. I’m going to find them and build them a better world, where they’re not hunted, not afraid.
Skye: And kill anyone in your way.
Jiaying: Only if they’re in our way. Goodbye, Daisy.
Skye: No, wait!
Mack: Come on, no-eyes! Show yourself!
Gordon: “No-eyes?” That is the best you can do?
Mack: Oh, you want clever? Come a little closer. I’ll get real clever.
Gordon: You’re different than the others. I sense you’ve encountered something Kree.
Mack: Wasn’t pleasant.
Gordon: I can imagine. So why don’t you put that thing down, avoid any further unpleasantness?
Mack: I don’t think so. I’ve seen what these crystals can do. So if you want them, you’re gonna have to come get…
Cal: Hi, honey. What you been up to?
Jiaying: You came back here, with them?
Cal: I know. I know what you’re thinking. But I’ve been thinking some thoughts of my own, like maybe we both kind of lost our heads.
Jiaying: Get out of the way, Cal.
Cal: No. You need to stop this. This isn’t about us or them. This is about our daughter. Think of what you are doing to Daisy.
Jiaying: I’m trying to protect her from the cruelty of this world like you swore to.
Cal: I know. I failed you. I failed you both. But we can turn this around. It is not too late.
Jiaying: For you, it is.
Cal: Where’s Daisy?! What did you do?! Where’s Daisy?! Where’s Daisy?!
Mack: What the hell took you so long?
Coulson: It’s a big boat with poor signage.
Mack: That no-eyed guy keeps popping in here, trying to get at these crystals. If he breaks them…
Coulson: Everybody’s a statue. We heard. Fitz?
Fitz: On it.
Coulson: Here. Take this.
Mack: Thanks, but I’ll stick with the ax. Ricochets in here will be bad. And trust me, you will miss.
Coulson: Right.
Mack: What are those things?
Fitz: Quantum field disrupters. Should contain him here if he comes back.
Mack: Of course. Why didn’t I think of that?
Fitz: That’s okay. You’ve been busy, and you’re not a quantum physicist. It’s completely understandable.
Coulson: Jiaying’s not the only one who can set a trap. You know, I batted over 400 in little league.
Alisha: Aah!
Lincoln: Hey!
May: My head still hurts.
Skye: I’m sorry. I didn’t know.
May: You didn’t know. But now we have to stop Jiaying.
Lincoln: Might help if we lose these.
Skye: Hurry. There will be more redheads coming. I’ll go after her.
May: Skye, I’ll do it. I’ve done it before.
Skye: No.
May: You have to be willing to…
Skye: I won’t hesitate. Whatever it takes.
May: Go.
Coulson: Damn it, you sneaky son of a… I hate this guy.
Mack: Fitz, hurry the hell up!
Fitz: Yeah, I’m almost there, but I need him back in the room before…
Coulson: Fitz, now! Hit it!
Gordon: I’m trapped in here. That’s not possible! What did you do?!
Fitz: Science, biatch.
Mack: Looks like it’s batter up, director.
Skye: Mom! Stop! You can’t do this!
Jiaying: No, put them on the jet and get ready for takeoff.
Skye: I can’t let you leave with those crystals.
Jiaying: You can, and you should. It’s the only way to protect our people.
Skye: It’s not. There are other ways.
Jiaying: Whose ways? S.H.I.E.L.D.? No. Their way is what got us here.
Skye: You started this war.
Jiaying: This war started decades ago, when S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded to guard the world against people like us. And it will never end. But you and I together, think of how powerful we could be. We could launch a revolution, side by side.
Skye: I don’t want your revolution, because this isn’t about protecting me or your people. This is about hate.
Jiaying: No, you’re wrong.
Skye: It’s consumed you. You can’t even tell right from wrong. I can’t let you destroy any more lives.
Jiaying: My daughter. So beautiful. So strong.
Skye: Mom, what are you…
Jiaying: I always believed the reason I endured all that torture and pain was for you, that you were my true gift. But you’re not. This is.
Skye: Don’t… do this.
Jiaying: You made your choice. I’m sorry.
Jiaying: No!
May: They’re gonna keep coming.
Lincoln: Not if we take out the source.
May: Got her.
Lincoln: We’re not bad. We’re misled.
Mack: Attaboy, turbo.
Cal: Please. Stop. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to live with that pain. I will.
Jiaying: Oh… Cal… what are you doing?
Cal: Keeping my promise.
Andrew: You ready to talk about it?
Coulson: About what?
Andrew: Your arm.
Coulson: Not yet. I’m looking into some options. I’d rather hear your evaluation of my team. Did you manage to get an accurate read on Bobbi?
Andrew: I get pretty straight answers with morphine in the mix.
Morse: Hey.
Hunter: Hey. You look better.
Morse: Hmm.
Hunter: Stupid, but better. Taking a bullet for me was stupid.
Morse: Walking into a trap when you know it’s a trap is stupid.
Hunter: You were the bait. Listen, Bob, hang in there. It’s a long road. Surgery again tomorrow. They haven’t even started on your knee yet. But soon, you’ll be stable, and then…
Morse: And then… I can’t do this anymore.
Andrew: You convinced Mack not to quit.
Coulson: Yeah, well, he kind of owed me after cutting off my hand without asking.
Andrew: He respects you. But he still holds a deep distrust of all the alien artifacts you’ve encountered.
Coulson: That’s why I put him in charge of them.
Simmons: You know, we could get better readings if we dropped a probe into the glass enclosure.
Mack: No, we’re never opening that damn box in 1,000 years.
Coulson: So, May asked for some time off for the first time in the history of ever. Does that have anything to do with you being around these last few days?
Andrew: Now, you know I can’t discuss personal matters with patients.
Coulson: I’m your patient now? I wasn’t your patient the other night when you and your ex-wife snuck into my office and drank up half my scotch.
Andrew: Ah, it’s time May rediscover the world outside of S.H.I.E.L.D., don’t you think?
Coulson: That your report?
Andrew: No, no, these are my recommendations for the new program. You bringing other people in on this yet?
Coulson: Slowly. I got Fitz working on these designs. We’ll need to be mobile.
Andrew: Yeah.
Coulson: Thank you. I’m glad you think Skye’s ready for this.
Andrew: At this point, I think she’s ready for anything.
Cal: This is so long… for now. After all I’ve done, I’d be a fool to think I’d get a Hollywood ending. Came close. I found you and got to… You know, you’re better than I imagined, and I imagined you perfect. You’re way more interesting than that.
Skye: I wonder where I get that from.
Cal: Ah. It’s paradoxical, isn’t it? My love for my family is what drove me mad? I know I’m going away for good, but I was hoping, you might come visit once in a while?
Skye: I will. I promise.
Cal: That would be…
Skye: Let me guess “the best day ever?” You have a lot of those.
Cal: No. Just one. July 2, 1988.
Bartender: Looks like you’re having trouble letting go, hate to see that, my friend. Did she walk out on you?
Ward: She drowned when her lungs filled up with blood.
Ward: These are all the names you could drum up?
Kebo: You’re lucky we found this many. Whitehall, Strucker, List. The leadership is gone, man. Usually, a head grows back, but not this time. The organization, disintegrated.
Ward: I want more names.
Kebo: And I want to marry into money. Do you speak English? No leadership means nobody giving orders, and that sure as hell includes you. Aah!
Ward: Do you understand who you work for now? Good. I’m done flying solo. I miss having a team around me. I want more names.
Man: Hail HYDRA to that. What’s the plan, sir? Chaos?
Ward: Closure.
Cal: Oh! Hey, there, little funny face. You coming to see me today, hmm? You come inside. We’ll get you a treat. Come on. Can I help you?
Skye: Just passing by. Nice place.
Cal: Oh, thanks. Well, we’re just getting up and running. It’s gonna be a magical place once we get totally moved in. You know, we already have adoption days every Saturday. Tell your friends. Free spaying and neutering, too. Just ask for Dr. Winslow. I’m sorry. And you are…
Daisy: Daisy.
Cal: That’s a lovely name. Remember, a house is not a home without a pet!
Daisy: Thank you for doing that for him. I know aspects of the Tahiti program don’t sit well with you.
Coulson: This does.
Daisy: He has a lot to give, and now a way to give it.
Coulson: And what about you? Are you ready to refocus your energies?
Daisy: A team centered around people with powers? How many on the list?
Coulson: Right now, just you. We’ll take it slow.
Daisy: I’ve thought a lot about it.
Coulson: And?
Daisy: And my mother was right about one thing, people like me need to be kept a secret, not like the Avengers, out in the open. If we do this, we need to be…
Coulson: Anonymous. That’s the idea. But it’s not if we do this. We have to do this. We don’t have a choice. It may feel like things have cooled down right now, but this… This is my permanent reminder that we’ll always be paying the price, that we’ll never get ahead of the consequences that I, that you, that S.H.I.E.L.D. have set in motion.
Daisy: Like a ripple in the water.
Coulson: But this ripple won’t fade. It’ll grow and grow until it’s a tidal wave.
Simmons: No, I don’t. You keep rambling on and on, and I still don’t know what you mean.
Fitz: Dinner.
Simmons: Fast approaching, yes, and we’ll eat it, I’m sure.
Fitz: Yeah, no, no, no. But, uh, me and you… maybe we could eat somewhere else, you know, somewhere… nice.
Simmons: Oh.
Fitz: Good. Okay. Uh, well, y… uh, you should come find me when you’re finished here, and… and I’ll … I’ll start working on options to run by you… for that.
Simmons: Ugh, what… Aah!
