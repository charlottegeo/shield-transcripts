Hunter: That won’t end well. Ohh.
Coulson: Get us in the air.
Mike: Will do.
Fitz: Mike?
Mike: Hey, Fitz. Good to see you again.
Fitz: New hardware. Hey, how did you upgrade…
Coulson: Not now, Fitz.
Hunter: Strap in.
Fitz: Hey, those tips for evading the tail were very useful. Thanks.
Coulson: The toolbox?
Fitz: Yeah, it’s been a while since I’ve been in the field solo. Not since, um…
Hunter: It looks like you held up all right.
Fitz: Yeah. Held up quite well, actually. And you?
Coulson: Fitz, we need to find Skye. Problem is, all we know is that she was taken by the same powered man who took Raina and Cal.
Fitz: Do we have any leads?
Coulson: No, but HYDRA might. HYDRA’s new heads… Strucker and List. My sources say they’re researching powered people. Apparently, they’re even more obsessed than Whitehall.
Hunter: We need to know what they know, get into HYDRA.
Fitz: Desperate times, desperate measures. Count me in.
Coulson: I’m relieved to hear you say that. We’re making a deal with Ward.
Man: Ethan Johnston, 26, potential enhanced. Died of cardiogenic shock in the 37th hour of experimentation.
List: Still no quantum signature?
Man: No, Dr. List.
List: That’s a waste. Take the cadaver to the lab. Compare him to the other samples. Hail HYDRA.
Cal: I told you I’d put our family back together.
Jiaying: Yes, you did.
Cal: Last night was… something… almost exactly as I imagined it. Some things were different. She’s still afraid of me.
Jiaying: Whose fault is that, Cal?
Cal: No, I know. I know. You’re right. I just… I-I wish she could have known me back when we were first married, when I was calm and my… my mind wasn’t so… jumbled.
Jiaying: We’ve both changed. We’re not the people we used to be. To lament that is a waste of time.
Cal: You’re right. She’s here now, with us, right? That’s pretty cool, right? Me being here puts you in a tough spot, I know. I-I know. I see the stink-eye from everyone.
Jiaying: They know you’re not like us. They’re wondering why you’re here.
Cal: I don’t want to make things harder for you. I’ll stay here, be quiet. I'llwait for our next family dinner. Hey, how about next time, we grill, huh?
Jiaying: Whatever you like. Yeah. In the meantime, why don’t I have Gordon take you to pick up some of your belongings so that your time here is less…
Cal: Prison-like? [Both chuckle] That would be fan-frigging-tastic. I miss my tunes.
Lincoln: Sorry. I wish I didn’t have to, but…
Skye: Is it my go?
Lincoln: You’re about a million miles away.
Skye: Sorry. I’m back at dinner.
Lincoln: Dinner with my parents can stress me out, too.
Skye: It wasn’t stressful, exactly. I mean, I didn’t want to see Cal, let alone be in the same room as him. I was sure he was gonna have some twisted surprise, but he didn’t. It was nice.
Lincoln: That’s good. Isn’t it?
Skye: Did Jiaying tell you that she’s sending Cal away? He’s not coming back.
Lincoln: He doesn’t exactly belong here. You think it’s a bad idea.
Skye: It’s not a good one. He’ll get upset, and someone will get hurt.
Lincoln: Talk to her. She’s your mom.
Skye: Yeah. It’s nice having someone normal to talk to. You hit me!
Morse: Finally, an actual partner. Little tip, you could’ve avoided losing your footing if you would have flipped into it.
Mack: Flip? Now you’re just making fun of me.
Morse: Maybe a little. It’s not like I can bench-press a small hatchback.
Mack: Yeah. We all have our talents.
Morse: How’s Simmons doing on Fury’s toolbox?
Mack: You ask me, she’s stalling.
Morse: Maybe.
Mack: It doesn’t bother you?
Mack: Ohh. I’m out.
Morse: Yeah, a lot bothers me. It bothers me that we’ve been so focused on Coulson and Fury’s toolbox. I mean, we have a… have a tail on Fitz, for god’s sakes. It’s not like HYDRA’s gone. Coulson may be a lot of things, but he’s not the enemy.
Mack: You sound like Hunter.
Morse: Well, he might have been right on this one.
Mack: Yeah, I’ve been wondering that myself. The only way to move forward right now is to get the truth out.
Morse: Any idea how to get the truth out of Fury’s toolbox?
Mack: Uh-huh. It’s flying in from the aircraft carrier as we speak.
Simmons: They’re bringing in some state-of-the-art, next-gen fiber laser.
May: That can cut through vibranium?
Simmons: If anything can.
May: Good. It’s time we have it all out in the open.
Simmons: It’s not exactly quite so simple.
May: Simmons, what did you do?
Simmons: I duplicated the box, switched out Fury’s real box for a fake, and all this time, I’ve been pretending to be working on it, when…
May: Where is the real box now?
Simmons: Fitz has it. I didn’t know who else to turn to. The… you’re the only one I can trust here anymore.
May: I’ll handle it.
Kara: Thanks for the picture, it really helped clear some things up. Wait, Mom, what men? When exactly did they call? Okay, if they call again, don’t say a word. I’ve got to go… call when I can.
Coulson: Agent 33. You’re looking well.
Ward: Hey, baby.
Coulson: Hey, sweetie. Why don’t you drop by? Love to catch up.
Mike: That mask on your face, got any more of those lying around?
Kara: Afraid not.
Mike: At least I have my winning personality.
Ward: They didn’t hurt you, did they?
Kara: No, I’m okay. You shouldn’t have come.
Ward: Fact that this guy hasn’t killed me yet means they need me. Mike.
Mike: Ward. Turn around. You know what needs to happen. All of it.
Coulson: Ward.
Ward: I’m flattered. Bringing the robot along just for a sit-down with me.
Coulson: There’s no need for false modesty. We both know you’re that good. But frankly, this isn’t about you. I’m after bigger fish. Strucker, List.
Ward: Can’t help you, not in HYDRA anymore.
Coulson: But you were.
Ward: Even then, I only knew them by reputation, never met either.
Coulson: Again with the false modesty. You’re resourceful. Bet you know a guy who knows a guy.
Ward: You know, last time I suggested we work together, you called me a deluded son of a bitch.
Coulson: Things change. I’m offering you a deal. Help me, and I’ll let you walk away, free and clear. No more looking over your shoulder.
Ward: When something’s too good to be true, it’s a lie.
Coulson: Not lying. I tried the stick with you before, it didn’t work so well, so I’m offering a carrot.
Ward: I’m listening.
Coulson: Get me inside. After that, I put you through the T.A.H.I.T.I. protocol, and then you’re free to go.
Ward: Wipe my memories? Well, that sounds like a threat, not a carrot. I like who I am.
Coulson: A murderer and a traitor? Sorry. My offer’s the only way you leave here. I’m taking a huge chance. You could’ve run. You didn’t. You risked your freedom for her. That says something, says that maybe there’s still good left in you. Maybe Garrett, your family didn’t destroy all that. T.A.H.I.T.I. will erase all the bad, let you be the man you wanna be, start over.
Ward: Free and clear.
Coulson: I give you my word as director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Ward: I might know a guy.
Simmons: No, no, no, no. No! I’d just hoped the highly modified hydrofluoric acid might cr…
May: Stop. I told her the truth.
Simmons: Truth about what, exactly?
May: Fitz replaced Fury’s toolbox with a fake, ran off with the real one, and you’ve been covering for him since.
Morse: Nobody’s happy about it. I understand you’re confused, who to trust, where to put your loyalties.
Simmons: Yes, I am.
Morse: But we’ve lost Coulson, the box, and Fitz. Eventually, I’m gonna have to tell Gonzales and the rest of the board what happened.
May: Unless we can find Coulson another way. You know Mike Peterson’s hardware.
Simmons: You want me to try to tap into his feed?
May: Will that be a problem?
Simmons: An opportunity to exonerate Coulson and Fitz? No, it’s not a problem. I’ll keep you updated.
Fitz: This is crazy. We want to find Skye, yes, okay? But we are making a deal with…
Hunter: The devil. I’m afraid it’s in the job description, mate. Expedient alliances with despicable characters.
Fitz: You’d work with Bobbi?
Hunter: No, not a chance. And point made. Look, mate, we’re infiltrating HYDRA. Our options are limited. Ward is a psychopath, but for now, he’s our psychopath, so we use him to stay one step ahead.
Jiaying: I’ve searched the records, no mention of precognition.
Gordon: Raina could be the first of her kind. I was. A gift like hers could change everything. Imagine, she could warn us of threats before they happen.
Jiaying: If that is her gift.
Skye: Ah, sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.
Jiaying: No, we’re finished here.
Gordon: I’ll let you know how it goes.
Skye: Was that about Cal? I want to talk to you about that. Cal’s dangerous, I know, but he’s better when he’s with us.
Jiaying: That may be true, but he can’t stay here.
Skye: Well, could we give him a heads-up or…
Jiaying: And risk how he gets? You think you’ve seen him at his worst. You haven’t.
Skye: That’s my point. You know how he’ll get when Gordon just abandons him in the middle of nowhere.
Jiaying: Not nowhere… we’re taking him home.
Skye: It doesn’t matter. He will feel abandoned, and people will get hurt.
Jiaying: Those people aren’t my concern.
Skye: Well, they’re mine. I’m a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Jiaying: The longer he stays, the more attention he draws, the more attention he demands. I can’t make exceptions. He’s not one of us. Sometimes, as a leader, I have to do things I’d rather not do.
Coulson: Did you get the package?
Mike: Just like they said. I still don’t trust them.
Coulson: Hell, no, but we need them to trust us.
Ward: Something’s not right. Why isn’t May here? There’s something Coulson’s not saying.
Kara: Which is why we should make a run for it. The idea of them wiping away who you are…
Ward: Hey, no one’s gonna wipe anything. We have the upper hand. Whatever Coulson’s endgame is doesn’t matter because he is gonna help us get to ours.
Kara: What’s this?
Ward: Thought we could put that on the windowsill.
Kara: It’s beautiful. It’s too bad. I liked our house.
Ward: It won’t be our last. Promise. At the end of this, you’ll be home. And we’ll be together.
Mike: Break it up. Let’s go.
Coulson: This just gets better and better.
Ward: Not to worry. We are working with Director Coulson. You’re gonna do whatever he says, understand?
Bakshi: Of course. I’m more than happy to comply.
Coulson: Get him out of there.
Cal: Hey. Um… sorry. Uh, I was expecting Gordo.
Skye: He can’t like you calling him that.
Cal: Oh, he loves it. Uh, come in. Uh, so, I was, uh, gonna find you today, but, um, I-I didn’t want to overdo it after last night. I-I tend to overdo. Big overdoer.
Skye: Yeah, I noticed.
Cal: Oh, so I guess you heard I’m gonna be out of here for a little bit.
Skye: Yeah, I heard.
Cal: Hey, you want to put in an order? I’ll bring you back something from the mainland. Gossip mags, soda pop. Do you like funyuns?
Skye: I’m… I’m okay, thank you. So, where are you going? China?
Cal: What makes you think I’d go there? No. God, no.
Skye: Oh, I-I’m sorry. Jiaying said that you were going home, so I just assumed that …
Cal: Oh, oh, of course. No, that makes sense. No, I was in China volunteering for doctors without borders.
Skye: Wow.
Cal: Hard to picture that, right? I was supposed to be there two weeks, but I met your mother and I couldn’t leave. She stole my heart. No, home is, um, Milwaukee. That’s where we were gonna bring you up. I should take you there sometime, I don’t know, maybe show you around the old haunts.
Skye: Why not tomorrow? I want to go with you.
Cal: Okay. Best day ever!
Skye: Yeah.
Skye: You can’t just leave him on the side of the road like an unwanted puppy. It’s irresponsible and cruel for both a puppy or Cal, and Cal’s not a puppy, he’s a pitbull, a raging pit bull who will attack if he doesn’t…
Jiaying: I don’t want to hear about the people you think you’re responsible for.
Skye: This isn’t about them. This is about me. You asked me to be decent, give Cal one dinner. I did that. And I… empathize.
Jiaying: After one night, you understand him?
Skye: Yes. Because I spent my entire life searching for you. I lied and I broke laws just to get the… the tiniest sliver of information. And I had no memories of my family. Cal had memories. He knows what he lost. Listen, I’m not… I’m not asking you to let him stay. Just let me go with him. I’ll talk to him. I’ll soften the blow , let him know I’ll visit and that… he hasn’t lost us forever.
Coulson: Bakshi reached out, arranged a meeting with Dr. List.
Hunter: And are we sure we trust Stepford Bakshi?
Ward: “Trust” might be a little strong. Bakshi’s been instructed to act exactly as he would have… before.
Hunter: Before the brainwashing. Oh, well, in that case, I feel comforted.
Coulson: Any questions?
Kara: How much longer?
Mike: A couple hours.
Ward: So, Fitz. How’ve you been?
Hunter: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Coulson: Sit down, Agent Fitz.
Hunter: Hey!
Fitz: Bakshi, sir. Bakshi. No, he is… he is… he’s the exact same as Ward. So he will double-cross us the second that he’s with HYDRA.
Coulson: Yes, he would… if he was going in alone.
Ward: He’s not?
Coulson: He’ll have his bodyguard with him.
Mike: That’d be me.
Coulson: We’ll monitor the entire meet through Mike’s eye.
Ward: Dr. List’s instructions were explicit. Bakshi was to come alone.
Coulson: Luckily, Bakshi’s good at talking his way out of things. Aren’t you?
Bakshi: I’ve been told it’s one of my more useful skill sets, yes.
Coulson: See? No problem.
May: Any luck?
Simmons: No.
May: They were going to find out, you know that.
Simmons: You do realize that it was my plan to switch the box, not Fitz’s?
May: We had to get out in front of it.
Simmons: I mean, he carried the plan out to perfection, but I handed him the schematics.
May: I don’t care whose plan it was.
Simmons: You threw Fitz to the wolves!
May: To protect you. They raided the base for that box. You’re lucky you’re not in a cell right now.
Simmons: I can’t believe what I’m hearing. You’re on their side.
May: It’s not about sides. It’s about the truth. Coulson left us with a mountain of lies, and the only way to understand his reasoning was inside that box.
Simmons: Honestly, I don’t care what’s in it. The only thing I know is that Coulson was just trying to protect Skye.
Cal: Thanks, Gordo. Now beat it.
Skye: Cal.
Gordon: I’ll be back when you’re ready.
Cal: We’ll let you know. Our first father-daughter date! Though “date” might be the wrong word. Is that weird? Is this weird?
Skye: Yeah. It’s weird. It’s a little weird. So, did you have an apartment around here or…?
Cal: Oh, I didn’t live her, worked here. My office is, uh, over there.
Skye: Oh, then where are we going? I thought you said you had to grab some of your things.
Cal: No, I told you I wanted to show you around. Thought we’d get a pastry, get to know each other a little?
Skye: Sure. Who doesn’t love pastry?
Cal: Right? Oh, there’s this great, little om-and-pop bakery just around the corner, Swedish place, Swiss. I don’t know. I mix them up.
Skye: What’s wrong?
Cal: You know what doesn’t have the smell of buttery goodness wafting out of it on your way to work?
Skye: A currency exchange?
Cal: Got to be someplace to eat around here.
Skye: So, you had a… you had a practice here?
Cal: Yeah, before I met your mother.
Skye: She was a doctor, too?
Cal: Studying to be one. She had a natural gift for it. Compassionate, beyond intelligent, wise, always five steps ahead of me. She wanted to finish med school here. Oh, and there was this great, little charter school just around the corner.
Skye: A charter school for medicine?
Cal: What? Oh, no, not for her, for you. Oh, it was gonna be perfect. I was gonna drop you off every morning and pick you up, help you with your science-fair project, the volcano, because who doesn’t love a volcano, right? We’d go to the father-daughter dances together, get ice cream. Ah, the life we could have had, should have had. I’m sorry. Memory lane isn’t always that fun to visit.
Skye: It’s okay.
Cal: Come on. I’ve got ice cream on the brain.
Fitz: We are online.
List: It’s good to see you alive and well, Mr. Bakshi.
Bakshi: Dr. List, a pleasure. You’re a difficult man to find these days.
List: Please.
Hunter: Three men, heavily armed, bet there’s more where they came from.
Ward: Does it matter? You got a cyborg on board with rockets in his arm.
Coulson: He’s not a cyborg, he’s a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent… with rockets in his arm.
List: Our world is much more complicated now after the tragic death of Dr. Whitehall and the ensuing bloodbath that it caused. Thank you. Tell me, Mr. Bakshi, exactly how did you manage to escape unscathed?
Bakshi: What are you implying, doctor?
List: Well, most of HYDRA’s leaders were wiped out in one fell swoop, but not you. I was just curious if you might know anyone involved.
Coulson: Let’s see how Bakshi holds up under questioning.
Kara: He’s held up to worse than this.
Bakshi: You think I poisoned the baroness? Killed Bloom?
List: Someone put a bullet in his head.
Bakshi: I assumed it was you… or Strucker. You had the most to gain, and look, here you sit, alive and well, with more money and manpower than ever.
Ward: See? Told you he was good.
Bakshi: The truth is, I didn’t escape unscathed. I was captured by the U.S. government. Mr. Peterson helped me escape. You do recognize him, don’t you? Well, you should. HYDRA invested quite a bit of funds turning Mr. Peterson into the perfect killing machine. Money well-spent, I might add.
Coulson: What’s he doing?
Ward: He’s gaining List’s trust.
Bakshi: I know Strucker has been experimenting on powered individuals. I believe that with a compliance upgrade, Mr. Peterson would prove quite useful to him.
List: You’re offering him to me?
Bakshi: Consider it a sign of good faith.
Coulson: This wasn’t the plan. What are you doing?
Ward: Getting us to Strucker.
Hunter: Bastard sold us out!
Coulson: Put the gun down now. Now!
Ward: It was the only way. Will you just listen to me?!
Coulson: I won’t gonna warn you again.
Ward: Do you want to get to Strucker or not?
Hunter: Fitz, are you all right?
Fitz: Yeah, I’m delightful.
Ward: Strucker wants powered people. Bakshi alone doesn’t get you to him. Deathlok does, and he can take care of himself, trust me.
Coulson: “Trust me?” I ought to shoot you just for saying that.
Fitz: Um, sir.
Ward: What if this goes South? Would you have been willing to sacrifice Mike?
Coulson: That wasn’t your call to make.
Fitz: Sir, Deathlok is, um…
Hunter: Is that Deathlok’s targeting system?
Fitz: Yes, he’s gonna… he’s… well, he… he’s about to kill everyone.
Hunter: Not a bad idea, actually.
Coulson: No, we need them alive. Fitz, tell Mike to stand down.
Fitz: Yeah, no, that’s not gonna happen.
Coulson: Let him go, 33.
Kara: My name is Kara, and I don’t work for you anymore.
Fitz: Weapons systems are hot.
Ward: On the count of three, we all put our weapons down.
Coulson: Three!
Coulson: You pull anything like that again, I’ll throw your ass off this quinjet at 20,000 feet.
Woman: Doctor, there’s been another incident.
List: Excuse me. We’re close. Put us in the air. And then we’ll see quite how loyal you and your enhanced friend really are.
Fitz: They’re taking off.
Ward: If Strucker’s overseas, I’d say that’s probably where they’re going.
Coulson: Then we tail them.
Cal: Bookstores, dead. Video stores, dead. Old-fashioned ice-cream shops, dead. The internet killed everything.
Skye: I’m not sure the internet killed ice cream, but, uh, how about we get a 40 ounce of malt liquor instead? I’m kidding, sort of.
Cal: A-ha! I learned something about you. You’re funny. That’s good.
Man: Oh.
Cal: Hey. Hey, where are your manners? Apologize to my daughter.
Skye: Hey. Hey. Calm down, okay? I bumped him. Sorry. That was… that was my bad.
Cal: Yeah. It’s all cool here.
Skye: You know what? I bet they have ice cream.
Cal: I’ll go see.
May: Hello?
Skye: May, it’s Skye. I need to talk to Coulson.
May: Skye, where are you? Are you all right?
Skye: Yeah, I’m okay, but I don’t have much time. Where’s Coulson?
May: He’s out, looking for you. Where have you been?
Skye: I’m with Cal, but I won’t be for long. And when I leave him, he’s gonna be pissed. Okay? Dangerous. S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to come get him and make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone.
May: Skye, slow down.
Skye: Okay, look, there’s no time to explain. Please, it’s just too complicated. Just don’t hurt him.
May: Skye, where are you? Skye?!
Cal: I got Neapolitan and vanilla. Uh, you pick.
Simmons: She left the line open for us. We’ll have the location in a minute.
Mack: She doesn’t sound like a hostage.
Morse: More like she’s playing along. Mack and I can take a team, go get them.
May: Do it.
Cal: You’re bored. Am I boring you?
Skye: No. You are a lot of things, but boring is not one of them.
Cal: Tell you what. Let’s head over to my old office, okay? There’s something there I want to show you, something really special.
Jiaying: Any word from Lincoln?
Gordon: Nothing yet.
Jiaying: They’ve been gone a while. I regret letting her go, but at least Lincoln’s there to protect her.
Gordon: Actually, there is something that needs your attention right now. It’s Ethan.
Jiaying: Ethan? I thought you dropped him off on a camping trip.
Gordon: I did, but when I went to bring him back, he was gone. I can’t find him anywhere.
Jiaying: Are you saying he’s missing… or worse?
Gordon: I’m not sure. But… even if they knew… who he was, that he was one of us. How can they get ahold of him?
Jiaying: Right now I’m not concerned with how as much as who.
Bakshi: We’re landing? Already? I thought Strucker was in Eastern Europe.
List: He is. But first, we’re making a stop. Have you heard of quantum entanglement, Mr. Bakshi?
Bakshi: No, I’m afraid not.
List: Well, we at HYDRA, for the last several months, actually…
Hunter: Quantum entanglement? Sounds like a method of torture.
List: … we have found incidents of photon intensity so great that particles can exist simultaneously in two spaces over great distances.
Hunter: Never liked science or big words.
Bakshi: But for something to be in two places concurrently…
List: No, no, no. This is a quantum entanglement bridge. We think it was created by a powered person, one we intend to capture.
Fitz: The teleporter… they’re tracking the teleporter, the one that, um, took Cal in Wisconsin and… and Raina.
Coulson: And Skye.
Ward: This is about Skye.
Kara: Why would HYDRA want her?
Coulson: Don’t know.
Cal: Please, uh, excuse the mess… and the, uh, the roaches.
Skye: Johnson, is that your last name?
Cal: Was. Pretty ordinary, huh? I changed it to something more sinister when I went on the run.
Skye: Daisy Johnson. Huh.
Skye: I, um, I had one of these.
Cal: Coincidence? I think not. Genetics. Keep it if you like.
Skye: How is all this stuff still here?
Cal: I own the building.
Skye: You own the building?
Cal: Mm-hmm, every wall, every bulb, every cockroach. I wasn’t rich, but you would have grown up quite comfortable. Had to shutter everything down after, uh, well, you know. Only been back a few times over the years.
Skye: So, this is like your stash pad, where you keep all of your old stuff?
Cal: Oh, I like that, “stash pad.” Makes it sound better than a crappy office. Okay. My grandfather’s field kit from WWII. I used this to put your mother back together again. The truth is, her gift was the real healer. She’s a walking miracle, your mother. The way she suffered and endured and fought through it.
Skye: You still love her.
Cal: How could I not? I mean, I know she resented me for a time after we lost you, but I think now that we’re back together, that we can…
Skye: Please, stop.
Cal: What? What? What’d I say?
Skye: We’re not all back together. You can’t hang on to the past like this. You need to move on. We all do. Jiaying, she’s responsible for all those people, and I… I-I’m an adult now. And as much as you want to turn back the clock to the time of science fairs and father-daughter dances…
Cal: They’re gone, yeah. I know. I know.
Skye: Look, it doesn’t mean that we can’t see each other. I could visit.
Cal: Visit? Where are you going?
Cal: Who’s there? Come out where I can see you.
Lincoln: Relax. It’s just me.
Skye: Lincoln. What are you doing here?
Lincoln: Jiaying sent me to make sure everything was cool.
Cal: Why wouldn’t everything be cool? What’s going on here? Wait a minute. Y-You think Daisy isn’t safe with me?
Lincoln: I didn’t say that. Just calm down.
Cal: Don’t patronize me. Who the hell do you think you are? I’m her father!
Bakshi: Fan out. If the teleporter is here, we want him alive.
Skye: Cal, let me explain.
Cal: No.
Skye: I…
Cal: What an idiot I’ve been, huh? I see what’s happening. You were gonna dump me here like yesterday’s trash. You don’t want to spend time with me. This isn’t daddy’s day out. This is goodbye.
Skye: It’s not forever, it…
Lincoln: Skye, don’t.
Cal: Her name is Daisy!
Skye: Cal!
Bakshi: Well, what are you waiting for?
Cal: After everything I did for Jiaying, for our family. Years of searching, the pain, and the rejection!
Lincoln: Cal, I’m warning you.
Cal: Oh, you’re warning me?
Skye: Watch out!
Cal: What’s S.H.I.E.L.D. doing here?
Skye: It’s not S.H.I.E.L.D., it’s HYDRA.
Cal: Get her out of here. I’ll take care of this. Hey, hey, fellas, huh?
Skye: I can handle myself.
Lincoln: No, don’t use your powers. You could bring the whole building down. I’ll help hold them off.
Cal: Let’s not lose our heads, okay?
Lincoln: Just go, please.
Fitz: Sir, it’s Skye. Skye’s here!
Coulson: Where?
Fitz: 10th floor.
Kara: The Skye who shot you three times?
Ward: Four.
Coulson: Don’t even think about it. You keep HYDRA off us. I’ll find Skye.
Lincoln: Hey.
Mike: Aah!
Lincoln: What are you made of?
Mike: Whoever you are, you don’t want to do this. I’m a friend of Skye’s.
Lincoln: Sure. And I’m the Hulk.
Fitz: Sir, Deathlok’s down. I’ve lost his feed. Oh. Uh, sir, I think somebody’s trying to hack into it.
Coulson: We need to split up!
Hunter: We’ll cover you. Go find Skye!
Hunter: Where the hell is your boyfriend going?
Kara: Look out!
Hunter: Aah!
Coulson: Skye? Skye!
Ward: Who the hell’s that guy?
Mike: Don’t know. Packs a mean spark. I think he’s protecting Skye.
Coulson: Where is she now? Can you scan the floor?
Simmons: Got him. Signal’s coming in.
Mike: Optics are down. I think she went around that corner.
Simmons: Bloody hell.
Mike: Stay down, kid. I got this. Where the hell you been? You missed all the fun.
Bakshi: Not quite. Take them both.
Coulson: Skye?
Skye: Coulson?
Gordon: I need to get you out of here.
Skye: No, no, not yet, no!
Cal: No, don’t go!
Coulson: I had her. Damn it! I had her.
Ward: Deathlok’s down. We’ve got powered people on-site. HYDRA’s storming the building.
Coulson: What happened to you?
Hunter: Ah, it’s merely a flesh wound.
Kara: A bad one.
Ward: We’re outmanned, outgunned, and our only backup is Fitz. Your call, boss.
Morse: Standard HYDRA issue. I’d say we missed them by less than an hour.
Mack: Hell of a fight, though. Looks like everyone cleared out.
Coulson: Not everyone. I doubled back after HYDRA took off. Their cleanup crew really sucks, doesn’t it?
Morse: What the hell happened here, Coulson?
Coulson: I’ll tell you all about it back at the base. Take me to your leader.
