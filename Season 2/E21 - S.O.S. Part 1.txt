Skye: Mom! What happened?
Jiaying: Gonzales… he… he said that we were… that Inhumans should be exterminated. He had a gun. No, stay with me, please. Gordon will take care of him. Get everyone to safety.
Lincoln: Everyone, this way!
Simmons: Let me take a look at that.
Jiaying: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s done enough. We have our own doctors. I’ll be fine in time. Right now we have more pressing concerns.
Skye: You should get out of here.
Simmons: What about you?
Skye: I…
Simmons: Come on.
May: Have you had any contact with Bobbi? Her Quinjet still hasn’t arrived, and she’s not answering communications.
Coulson: How’s Skye?
May: Disappointed that you aren’t the one meeting with her mother.
Simmons: Agent May. Sir, there’s been gunfire. Skye’s mother’s been shot, allegedly by Gonzales. I’m afraid it’s going to get worse.
Coulson: What about Gonzales? Where’s he?
Simmons: I don’t know.
Fitz: Got what he always wanted.
Coulson: No. He wouldn’t do that. It has to be something else. Find Gonzales. Get everyone out. I don’t want to escalate the situation till we find out what we’re dealing with.
May: Have all three birds ready to fly the second I return. He may be a part of it. Make sure he’s secured.
Man: Agent May wants all Quinjets ready for evacuation. Prep for takeoff.
Agent: Something’s happening. The teleporter’s moving.
Lincoln: We need to get you to the doctors.
Jiaying: Okay.
Skye: Come on! Help me!
Jiaying: Why would you let them do this to us? I thought you were on our side.
Skye: I am. I-I had no idea, I swear.
Alisha: Jiaying, I’m here.
Lincoln: We got to get you out of here.
May: Skye, stop!
Skye: What have you done?
May: That’s what we’re trying to figure out, but you need to stand down. Stand down?
Skye: After Gonzales just shot my Mom and declared war on us? You’re the one who needs to stand down.
May: I need to see Gonzales. Where is he? We can fix this.
Skye: It’s too late to fix this. Now take your men and get the hell out of here.
May: Not until I see Gonzales.
May: I don’t want to hurt you!
Skye: You won’t.
May: Stop wasting time, Skye, help me fix this.
Skye: I’m sorry, May, you’re not welcome here.
Mack: And my brother’s been on me for years, wants us to motorcycle down to Baja.
Oliver: Beaches and desert, you’ll get bored.
Mack: Truthfully, bored would be a nice change of pace.
Oliver: So… there’s nothing I can say?
Mack: To change my mind? No. I just need some time to figure out my next move.
Mack: Harris, what happened?
Harris: Gonzales is dead.
Oliver: What? When?
Harris: At the sit-down. That’s what people are saying. We’re waiting on orders.
Cal: ♪ I’m half-crazy ♪
Coulson: Jemma, do we have confirmation on who actually fired the missile?
Simmons: No, sir, we’re still sorting out what happened with that Quinjet. Our priority was to get all S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel out safely.
Coulson: Was there any resistance to that from the locals?
Weaver: No, they seemed as keen on leaving as we were, perhaps retreating to shelters or bunkers.
Coulson: Or they evacuated. We know they have a powered way out. May.
May: Where’s Skye?
Simmons: How are you feeling?
May: I have a headache, and I asked a question.
Simmons: None of this would have happened if Gonzales hadn’t attacked.
Weaver: You can’t actually believe he would do something like this.
Simmons: Oh, no, Gonzales would never attack a base unprovoked.
Weaver: Robert did not do this!
May: How can you be sure?
Weaver: Because he went to great lengths for me to get a gift for Jiaying, a peace offering.
Coulson: I agree. Gonzales was smarter than this. It’s too sloppy.
Weaver: I recommend we respond with a strong show of force.
Coulson: I have no intention of starting a war before I understand the situation. Agent Weaver, you’re now the highest-ranking officer on the carrier. I want you to head back there and await further instructions.
Weaver: Yes, sir.
Coulson: I don’t believe that Skye would turn against us.
May: You didn’t see her fight me.
Coulson: Her mother had just been shot. I can believe she’s confused.
Simmons: No more than the rest of us. Why invite SHIELD only to attack?
Coulson: I don’t know, but maybe their peace offering over there does.
Cal: ♪ but you’ll look sweet ♪ ♪ upon the seat of a bicycle made for two ♪
Skye: I thought that with her healing powers, the pain…
Lincoln: Wouldn’t be there? No such luck. Her gift can heal the tissue damage with time, but she feels all of it.
Skye: Does she need any blood? I can… I-I can donate or… or what…
Lincoln: I think you’ve helped enough.
Skye: What is that supposed to mean?
Lincoln: It means Jiaying was right. S.H.I.E.L.D. couldn’t be trusted. But you convinced her otherwise. Why?
Skye: You think I knew about any of this?
Jiaying: Lincoln. Skye.
Skye: I never meant for this to happen I swear.
Jiaying: I should have been more careful. S.H.I.E.L.D. has done this before. I hoped they had changed. Skye feels as betrayed as we do, Lincoln, maybe more.
Skye: I don’t think we know the full story. Coulson wouldn’t do any…
Jiaying: I can’t do this right now. I’d like everyone to leave. I need rest if I’m going to heal.
Hunter: Her phone’s not picking up, not even voicemail.
Fitz: Flight records suggest that Bobbi’s Quinjet left before the other three. There’s no indication of a crash. The transponder’s offline. Uh, it’s possible that somebody disconnected it, though.
Hunter: Forget about the plane. Can you pull up the…
Fitz: Footage from Bobbi, of the base, before she left, good idea.
Hunter: You know, I am capable of finishing my own…
Fitz: Sentences. Yes, you are. I’m sorry.
Skye: You knew, didn’t you? Your visions, you saw fire, destruction. You knew it would all fall apart.
Raina: I’m afraid so. Everyone thinks flowers are so delicate. They really are quite resilient.
Skye: I’m not here to talk botany.
Raina: No, you’re here to ask questions about what’s gonna happen next.
Skye: Yes.
Raina: Well, that’s the tragedy, because even if I were inclined to tell you, you wouldn’t believe me, not with our history.
Skye: Forget history, I don’t care about the past. Just…
Raina: Well, you should, because the past and the future are intertwined, just like us. Our paths have been intertwined since before we even met, and I’m not talking about DNA. You and I have spent our entire lives searching for our destiny, and I finally have the answer. I had a vision today, and it revealed the truth. I’ve seen it.
Skye: Tell me.
Raina: You wouldn’t believe me.
Skye: Raina.
Raina: It is the thorn that protects the rose. Or, in this case, the Daisy.
Skye: Please, stop with the metaphors.
Raina: It’s not a metaphor. That’s the irony. My true purpose, my destiny is to help you become what you’re supposed to be.
Skye: Why the hell did I even come here?
Raina: Because you want answers. You’re just not willing to hear them. In fact, we’ll never speak to each other again. But you’ll see. Your mother isn’t leading our people, she’s misleading them. It’s you who are destined to lead. Even in the darkness, you’ll see the truth.
Jiaying: The evacuation?
Gordon: I’ve taken everyone that needed protection back to their homes. The rest await your orders.
Jiaying: I’m confident Lincoln will fight with us, as well, when the time comes. He’s convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. is the threat.
Gordon: That’s true of everyone. Your plan worked. They’re all willing to fight because S.H.I.E.L.D. attacked. What about your daughter?
Jiaying: I’m hopeful she’ll do the right thing. We’ve gone to great lengths to ensure it. First, I need to get better. I need to heal. I’m so sorry.
Coulson: You want to tell me what you’re really doing here?
Cal: Sure. I’m a present, a gift horse, a peace offering from my family. I’m also an excellent Shanghai rummy partner.
Simmons: Sir, I’m worried he’s more of a trojan horse. I believe Cal took these before he was handed over to us. I’m going to analyze them in the lab.
Coulson: Go. Have we lost Skye?
May: We didn’t lose Skye. She chose.
Fitz: Okay, that’s May.
Hunter: Yeah, and that’s the woman that once set my 1967 Convertible GTO on fire. The question on the table is not who, but where.
Fitz: No, that’s what I’m saying. Facial recognition time-stamped this routine 10 minutes later. See? That’s May leaving the base… again.
Hunter: It’s Agent 33.
Fitz: What would she want with Bobbi?
Kara: You know why you’re here, but I want to hear you say it.
Morse: Sure, I’m here because you’re a twisted psychopath, and once…
Kara: Wrong answer.
Ward: Shouldn’t waste your energy, baby. We’ll stay here as long as it takes. We’ll get her to admit what she did to you. Sunil Bakshi gave up some surprising information when we were finding closure with him. He said that you knowingly handed Agent Kara Palamas over to HYDRA. You are the reason she suffered months of torture and mind control at the hands of her enemy. You are here to confess that truth, to give Kara the closure she needs to move on, to heal, the way I’ve healed.
Morse: Good luck with that.
Ward: It’s not luck that’s gonna help us. Kara tells me you don’t like needles.
Skye: How are you even up?
Jiaying: A skilled doctor, the generosity of others. Honestly, having you here is the best medicine I could hope for.
Skye: Okay, but I’ve been shot before, a-and this i-is…
Jiaying: Inhuman? What’s wrong?
Skye: Everything. S.H.I.E.L.D. attacking, you getting shot, me fighting May, the threat of more people dying? This is way up there on one of the worst days ever. And I talked to Raina. She warned that bad things are gonna happen. I was hoping she’d have answers.
Jiaying: Thought you didn’t trust her.
Skye: I don’t, and I shouldn’t have gone. She’s full of lies, and she’ll never change.
Jiaying: We have more pressing work. The safety of our people.
Skye: How? S.H.I.E.L.D. can find us anywhere.
Jiaying: Which is why we have to stop hiding and fight.
Skye: You want to take the battle to S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Jiaying: You’ve seen more clearly than anyone how they treat people who are different, who have gifts.
Skye: I know, but to…
Jiaying: If our people are ever going to be safe, I need you standing by my side. I know it’s a lot to ask, and there’s little time. Bring this back to me if you decide to join our fight.
Coulson: Skye’s mother orchestrated the whole thing. It was a performance. The Quinjet they stole only fired on the one building. Nobody got hurt.
Simmons: Except Commander Gonzales. It either killed him or destroyed any evidence of foul play against him.
May: If it’s theater, it worked. Every Inhuman up there believes that S.H.I.E.L.D. attacked their leader and declared war.
Simmons: Including Skye.
Hunter: Then mark that down as the second time S.H.I.E.L.D. got played today.
Fitz: Figured out what happened to Agent Morse. She left on a Quinjet with… you.
May: I didn’t leave with Bobbi. That’s…
Coulson: Agent 33.
Fitz: She killed her guard, stashed him under a blanket in Vault C, then boarded a Quinjet posing as May.
Simmons: But why? I don’t understand.
Hunter: The Quinjet’s transponder went dark outside Aranda de Duero in Spain. I’m gonna need a pilot.
May: With pleasure.
Coulson: This reeks of Ward. He left Agent 33 here for this very purpose.
Hunter: But why take Bob? Did she have a history with him?
Coulson: Not that I know of, but Ward’s logic is rarely logical. There’s a piece we don’t understand yet.
May: There’s a piece that Ward doesn’t understand. When I find him, I’m going to kill him.
Hunter: Glad we’re on the same page.
Ward: Any agent worth their salt adjusts to pain, can push it away. So I took a different approach, paralytic combined with an anesthetic. You can’t fight what’s happening, nor can you feel any of the pain yet. Crazy, huh? Now, in a little while, the drug will turn off. Everything you’re not feeling will, mnh, flood in at once.
Kara: It’s how I felt after the mind control was removed. I remembered every terrible thing they did to me.
Ward: Now, we can avoid all that pain if you cooperate. Admit your sins.
Morse: What happened to you was a tragedy.
Kara: Not good enough.
Morse: I had to make a choice when I was inside HYDRA. Protect my cover by giving them a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house that might be occupied or blow my cover and lose intel that I knew for a fact would get two dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents killed.
Kara: So you did sell me out.
Morse: I’m sorry you were in that safe house, but I did the right thing. The lives of the many outweigh the life of one. You… You swore to the same ideal when you signed to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Ward: That’s your apology?
Morse: Oh. I’ll go one better. If I ever apologize or beg for mercy while you torture me, know that I don’t mean a word of it, not a word. I made a hard call. I’d make the same one again right now.
Weaver: They destroyed the device we used to track the Teleporter. Not knowing their next move is exactly why S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to end this before it goes any further.
Coulson: I agree that losing the tracking device is a big setback. Satellite imaging suggests their compound’s been all but deserted.
Weaver: That doesn’t mean we can’t strike.
Coulson: Until I know more, I won’t be forced into action. We may still have assets in there.
Oliver: Agent Skye? She could expose us. She knows every S.H.I.E.L.D. procedure.
Weaver: You’re gambling with our lives because of one agent. The security of S.H.I.E.L.D. far outweighs the safety of Skye.
Coulson: It’s not her safety it’s her usefulness. Mack, I thought you left.
Mack: I did, but with Gonzales dead, I need to see this settled first.
Weaver: So, you agree we should attack?
Mack: No. I agree it needs to be settled.
Coulson: I’m not sure whether I’m happier you haven’t left yet or that you agree with me for once. I understand Skye could be a threat, but she’s also our best bet for resolution. I have her father here. Give me a few hours to gather more information.
Weaver: Three hours. We’ll continue gathering intel on this side.
Mack: Is there a problem?
Weaver: Only time will tell.
Mack: What about the alien thing in the cargo hold? Could be what this is all about.
Weaver: I’ve already doubled the guard. You used to be chief engineer. If you’re sticking around, make yourself useful. This ship needs to be battle ready.
Cal: I’m not a polar bear, Phil. So why is it colder than bloody blue hell down here, huh? And, uh, what’s with the, uh… the doodad on my wrist, huh?
Coulson: That doodad monitors your vitals. I’ll get you another blanket if you’d like, or maybe some hot cocoa.
Cal: Are you mocking me? Torturing me after I willingly turned myself in?
Coulson: Torture isn’t my thing, Cal, and surrender doesn’t really seem like yours. Why did Jiaying send you?
Cal: Do you have children, Phil?
Coulson: I do not.
Cal: Well, then, you’ll never understand what a father will do for his child. Never imagine my pain when SHIELD stole my daughter.
Coulson: We’ve been over this. It wasn’t S.H.I.E.L.D., it was HYDRA. And didn’t you get your vengeance back in the day? My understanding is you single-handedly killed a whole lot of people.
Cal: Oh! I suppose that’s true.
Coulson: I’m curious how you did it.
Cal: With style.
Coulson: Tell me you figured out what drugs Cal took, because my gut’s saying everything ever made.
Simmons: I haven’t fully sequenced the formula yet, if only for the multitude of trace drugs found, but my initial list includes anabolic-androgenic steroids, a liver enzyme blocker, various metabolic enhancers, methamphetamines, what appears to be gorilla testosterone, and, no lie, a drop of peppermint. I think it’s an ill-conceived attempt at super strength.
Coulson: Other than cap, every attempt has been ill-conceived. Will he survive it?
Simmons: A single vial would send any normal man to the hospital. Skye’s father took three. He should be dead.
Kara: It’s happening. She feels it.
Ward: Once she understands your pain, we can all move past this unpleasantness.
Morse: Don’t you see what’s happening? He’s molding you, the way that Bakshi molded you. The circle never ends.
Ward: You left her for dead. I’m helping her heal from wounds you inflicted.
Morse: Then take her to Hawaii. Do you think it’ll end with me? There’s always someone else to blame.
Kara: You’re wrong.
Morse: I bet he started you off easy, symbolic target, maybe the doctor who made your mask. Ward probably started off easy, too.
Kara: You’re right. It was his dog. Garrett made him kill his dog. I know what you’re doing, Agent Morse, and it’s not going to work. Grant’s already told me everything. Everything. About his abusive family, about John Garrett, about having to kill Victoria Hand. But in the end, he overcame his family and the pain Garrett put him through. He remade himself. It’s why I love him, and why no matter what he does, I will always stand with Ward.
Jiaying: Thank you for meeting me, Raina.
Raina: How are you feeling?
Jiaying: Stronger. I should have listened to your warning about S.H.I.E.L.D.
Raina: I hadn’t foreseen you getting attacked. I would have told you.
Jiaying: These are dangerous days. I’m grateful for your visions. You’ll be a valuable adviser.
Raina: Adviser. Growing up, my dream was to lead the Inhumans.
Jiaying: Life is rarely what we dream.
Raina: I’ve learned that more painfully than most. And now I’ve come to accept it. It is not for me to lead, but to illuminate. I’ve seen the future and your plan.
Jiaying: Does it succeed?
Raina: There’s only one thing that can save the Inhumans from death and destruction. And it is neither you nor I. It’s Skye. I’ve considered killing her and you, running from my fate. But then, I realized what my grandmother used to say, that one day, I would be an angel. And I realized her words have come true. I am not a monster. I am an angel. I’m finally what I’m meant to be.
Jiaying: I’m happy to hear you say that.
Raina: Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they’re also heralds, sent to reveal the truth. And that is my purpose. I’m here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are. Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.
Jiaying: No. They won’t.
Skye: What did you do? How could you?
Jiaying: She threatened me. You tried to warn me, but I didn’t listen until it was almost too late.
Skye: She knew I would see this. She said as much. She saw who you really are, so you killed her.
Jiaying: Everything I’ve done, everything I will do is for the protection of our people.
Skye: You killed Gonzales. You want a war.
Jiaying: War was inevitable. I struck first so we would have the advantage.
Skye: He came to make peace!
Jiaying: Peace? I built this community in the middle of nowhere so we would be left in peace. Yet, S.H.I.E.L.D. found us. No matter where we go or what we do, they will hunt us down. If we are to survive, S.H.I.E.L.D. must be destroyed.
Skye: What are you planning?
Jiaying: I am planning for our future, your future. Daisy, I won’t live forever, and when I’m gone, you must lead these people, protect them as I have done.
Skye: Protect them? You killed Raina. You are leading them into a war! If they need protection, it is from you!
Jiaying: I’m sorry you feel that way. Restrain her. Take her with you. When this is done, hopefully she’ll understand. And dispose of Raina’s body.
Coulson: What is her plan?
Cal: Could… Could I get a glass of that water?
Cal: Ohh. May I have another one to drink?
Coulson: That depends on your cooperation.
Cal: They just want to live in peace. Is that such a crime?
Coulson: Your wife assassinated a high-ranking SHIELD officer, then staged it to look like we attacked them. Wake up, Cal. She’s trying to start a war, and your daughter’s gonna be caught in the middle of it.
Cal: I don’t believe you. Neither of us would ever do anything to hurt our daughter.
Coulson: No. But you’d do anything to protect her. Look at yourself. Whatever was in these, it’s killing you. Was getting rid of you part of her peace plan?
Cal: You got it all wrong, Phil. That little concoction is my own special formula. I took it of my own free will. You see, when my Daisy was stolen, I wasn’t strong enough to protect her, so I started experimenting. If I wasn’t born with Inhuman powers, then I would make my own. Best-laid plans. C'est la vie. I never got it quite right, always missing something. Highly unstable. Made me a little moody. Could it kill me? Sure. But it was worth the risk.
Coulson: You’re here to take out some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Cal: No. I’m here to take out as many as I can.
May: At least they didn’t crash.
Hunter: Maybe they both just needed a holiday. Bobbi always liked Spain. Probably sitting on a beach, telling 33 what a lousy husband I was. I did have my faults.
May: Hunter.
Hunter: That’s my Bob. Never goes down without a fight. What the hell does Ward want with her?
May: No idea. But if anyone can handle him, it’s Bobbi.
Ward: Gonna be a long night. I knew you’d be tough. Coulson’s got a good eye for talent, though he’s a little blind when it comes to spies in his own house. You know, you and I are a lot alike, both of us living one life on the outside. But who we really are, we keep that buried deep inside where no one can ever find it. That’s why Coulson never saw us coming. That’s why you never saw me coming.
Morse: Where’s Kara?
Ward: Sleeping. Oh, but don’t worry. I can go all night. I need you to help me help her. Kara needs closure. Admit that you betrayed her, and we can end this. You’re such a hypocrite. You say I betrayed her? You betrayed your entire team. How many people who trusted you have died? Yeah, I’ve seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside. He’s a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.
Ward: You don’t know me.
Morse: Sure, I do.
Ward: Now, is there anything you’d like to say to Kara?
Morse: Yeah. I’d do it all again.
Kara: This isn’t right. I’m not feeling it. She doesn’t care if she dies, and she’s not sorry.
Ward: It’s okay, baby. I know what to do.
Oliver: Hey, Mack, everything checking out?
Mack: What can I say? I do good work. I’m headed down to machine room 2 to run a systems test.
Oliver: Copy that. Keep me posted.
Jiaying: Where are the others?
Gordon: Already in their places.
Coulson: If you hurt anyone here, Daisy will never forgive you.
Cal: Stop calling her that!
Coulson: Sorry. I thought th… never mind.
Cal: She’s “Daisy” to me and her mother, not you, not anyone else.
Coulson: Fair enough, but my point is she’s been led to believe that you’re a monster.
Cal: Innuendos! Lies!
Coulson: Well, you did wipe out an entire village.
Cal: They were trying to hide her from me!
Coulson: It was Jiaying’s idea to destroy that village, wasn’t it? Just like this was her idea. She told you to take this. She didn’t care if it killed you. She’s using you to do her dirty work.
Cal: No! No! More lies!
Coulson: You’ve always done her dirty work. She’s the real monster.
Cal: She’s not like me.
Coulson: No. She’s worse.
Cal: She’s not a monster!
Simmons: Clear.
Fitz: No response.
Coulson: We can’t lose him.
Fitz: I thought you said he wanted to kill us!
Coulson: He’s Skye’s father. We have to try.
Simmons: I’m doing what I can. Get me an adrenaline injector, one milligram. Fitz, I need it now.
Cal: You were looking for a monster?
Coulson: Everybody, out.
Cal: Hmm. This is what I was missing.
Coulson: Cal? Cal, listen to me. Cal, I can take you to Daisy, but you need to calm down.
Cal: This is me calm, Phil. Aah!
Coulson: Fitz, I’m open to suggestions.
Fitz: ICERs are a good start.
Coulson: Agreed. Got to admit, I’m not hopeful these will do anything but piss him off.
Simmons: There are more lethal solutions.
Coulson: Not yet. He’s Skye’s father. Or at least, he was. I’m hoping there’s still a sliver of the man who… Uh-oh.
Cal: Oh. And there goes the feeling in my legs.
Coulson: Get out of here.
Fitz: No, sir.
Coulson: Now, go! Cal.
Cal: Phil. Time for you to go night-night. Time for the big sleep. Time to die. For everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. to die!
Coulson: This is Jiaying’s plan, not yours.
Cal: So what? I’ve always done whatever she asks. It makes me happy. It’s why she loves me.
Lincoln: Careful with her. She’s unconscious, not dead. Just lock her up. We have to move fast.
Hunter: A day ago, I never wanted to talk to her again. Now she’s all I can think about.
May: Love’s weird that way.
Hunter: I’m not sure it’s love. More like a dance of desire, discomfort, and unreliable feelings. Hold on. Bobbi’s phone’s back in service. Shouldn’t be too hard to trace this to a location.
May: Could be a trap.
Hunter: Been there, done that. Most of my marriage to Bobbi felt like a trap. But, we did have our good times. So you up for this?
May: If it means finding Ward and putting a bullet in his head, I’m all in.
Hunter: Guess love is weird that way.
Ward: That was fast. Someone must really miss their honey bunny. You think he’ll come for you, hmm? Since you’ve shown no remorse for your sins against Kara, since you clearly have no regard for your own life, we’re leaving you a little present. First person through this door… brains everywhere.
Kara: I wonder what you’ll feel when you watch somebody else die because of what you did.
Ward: I know what we’ll feel. Closure.
Man 1: Ohh!
Man 2: Shots fired!
Man 3: We’re clear!
Gordon: Weapons down or everybody dies.
Mack: What did you do with Skye?
Alisha: Follow me, and I’ll show you.
Mack: I can’t wait to get off this boat.
Alisha: Hangar deck’s ours. I’m headed down to secure the armory. I’m also upstairs in the conference room.
Oliver: Comms are down. Engines are down. They’ve shorted out most of the electrical on the ship. They’ve taken both reactor compartments, the crew quarters, as well as the hangar deck.
Weaver: Good god. Get me a secure channel to Coulson at H.Q. We need to warn him.
Man: Copy that.
Weaver: Do we have anybody left still fighting below?
Weaver: Director Coulson, we are under attack from an unknown number of gifted assailants. They have killed dozens of my men. We need your help. I’m sending our…
Fitz: Jemma, run! Run!
Cal: Yes, let’s all run!
Coulson: Now it’s just you and me. And we’re gonna talk.
Alisha: All clear.
Gordon: The ship’s been taken. Most of the crew have been secured on a lower deck. Anyone unaccounted for will be found on our next sweep.
Lincoln: Now what?
Jiaying: Now we begin.
