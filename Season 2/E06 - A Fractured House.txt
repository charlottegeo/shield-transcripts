Talbot: I was here in 2012 when the sky tore open and the Chitauri rained down on us. Aliens. Aliens were running through the streets, and it was then that S.H.I.E.L.D. revealed themselves and stood with the Avengers, leading us to believe that we could put our faith in them, which we did. We stood idly by while they collected super-powered individuals, garnered alien weapons, built bases on virtually every continent. We thought S.H.I.E.L.D. was protecting us, but in truth, they took advantage of our good faith, and they still are.
Man: Italy takes note of your report, general. Now, you say that you’ve seen S.H.I.E.L.D., even fought against them. But where is the proof? Where is… Aah! Che diavolo! Help!
Officer: It’s S.H.I.E.L.D.! Go! Freeze!
Woman: It’s S.H.I.E.L.D.
Man: Get out! Get out!
Talbot: Go to the exit in the corner. Go! Come here. Come here.
Scarlotti: S.H.I.E.L.D. is done hiding.
Simmons: 5:30 on the dot every morning. But there’s no clock, no light, no way he can know what time it is.
Skye: You’ve been watching him?
Simmons: Every day before I left, every day since I got back. I don’t know how you do it, going down there, talking to him.
Skye: Sacrifices we make for valuable intel, right?
Simmons: Yeah.
Skye: Jemma Simmons undercover at HYDRA.
Simmons: I thought I was a dead woman at least four times.
Skye: I’m glad you’re not.
Simmons: Me too. Be careful with him, Skye.
Skye: I am. What’s happening?
May: There’s been an attack on the U.N.
Reporter: An attack today of the U.N. left six dead and dozens injured. Among the injured, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s biggest opponent, U.S. air force Brigadier General Glenn Talbot.
Talbot: Sir, this wasn’t us, was it?
Coulson: No, this is HYDRA looking for revenge. Best guess… Daniel Whitehall had his people impersonate S.H.I.E.L.D. to put the world’s attention back on us.
Skye: So much for staying in the shadows.
Coulson: Somebody bring this from home? I want you two scouring government channels, see what we’re up against.
Triplett: On it, sir.
Coulson: And, Skye, this means the alien writing…
Skye: Back burner. just until we get this under control.
Simmons: Just saw the news. We’re not responsible for this, are we, sir? Didn’t think so. Just wanted to triple-check.
Morse: Marcus Scarlotti was behind the attack. An assassin… almost killed Barton a few years back. Runs a team of mercenaries… mostly for HYDRA.
Simmons: Ah. The bodies just disintegrate. I saw references to this weapon in HYDRA’s lab. Yeah, sent from their demolitions expert, uh, Toshiro…
Morse: Toshiro Mori. I’ve crossed paths with him before. He has a lab in Okinawa.
Coulson: Good. Then that’s where you’re going. We need to find the location of the next attack and stop it before it happens. May’s taking point on this op. You can meet her and Hunter in the hangar.
Morse: Hunter’s going? Got it. Thank you, sir.
Coulson: I need you to dig through the hard drive you brought back from Whitehall’s lab.
Simmons: I’ll find out whatever I can about those weapons.
Hunter: Coulson, quick question.
Coulson: No, this wasn’t us.
Hunter: Oh, tha… uh, great. Um… May said I’d be going on a mission with Bobbi?
Coulson: Is that gonna be a problem?
Hunter: Did she say it was gonna be a problem?
Coulson: I won’t dignify that with a response.
Hunter: So… she… didn’t?
Coulson: I think we all know how you feel about your ex-wife, but if it’s too complicated, then by all means. Whitehall’s on the attack. And instead of using his own forces to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D., he’s having the rest of the world do it for him.
Christian Ward: You’re lucky to be alive, general.
Talbot: My lucky day.
Christian Ward: It was my understanding that you had S.H.I.E.L.D. under control. Otherwise, I don’t know why I persuaded the armed services committee to give your unit such extraordinary funding.
Talbot: Because it worked… until this morning.
Christian Ward: I don’t think anything before today matters now, does it? S.H.I.E.L.D. attacked the United Nations, for god’s sake, under your watch.
Talbot: People who attacked us may not have been S.H.I.E.L.D.
Christian Ward: It’s time I step in.
Talbot: And do what?
Christian Ward: Control the situation. Now that S.H.I.E.L.D.’s back in the spotlight, the press is gonna take this and run with it.
Talbot: You’re worried they’re gonna find out about your brother, aren’t you?
Christian Ward: What worries me is that you even know about him.
Talbot: I don’t play politics, senator. I haven’t said one word about your brother to anyone, and I don’t intend to.
Christian Ward: The truth is, general, you can’t assure me of anything. It time I do what I should’ve done months ago… put S.H.I.E.L.D. in the ground for good.
Christian Ward: S.H.I.E.L.D. is a terrorist organization, and they should be treated as such.
Reporter: Is that what you plan to speak about at the U.N.’s emergency session tomorrow?
Christian Ward: What I plan to do is lay out a proposal for a multi-national police force that will target those suspected of ties with S.H.I.E.L.D. Using any and all means necessary.
Beckers: Anyone suspected of ties? And who determines that? Belgium will never accept this proposal. It destroys the very idea of citizens’ rights.
Christian Ward:: Mr. Beckers, if you want to welcome S.H.I.E.L.D. at your borders with open arms, be my guest, but this infestation needs to be exterminated.
Skye: Guess being a douche-bag runs in the family.
Coulson: Are you surprised?
Skye: Ward’s brother never cared about S.H.I.E.L.D. before.
Coulson: Not openly.
Skye: Yeah, but Hunter said that Talbot was working with a senator who had deep pockets. You think it’s him?
Coulson: I do. Months rebuilding, and this is S.H.I.E.L.D. Few operatives here, not many more out there. If Senator Ward’s proposal passes…
Skye: It’ll be a witch-hunt.
Coulson: Every military organization on the planet will have a license to kick our operatives’ doors down and shoot them on the spot. I can’t let that happen.
Skye: I’ll talk to Ward, see if he has any intel on his brother.
Coulson: And, Skye… keep the focus on his family, not yours.
Coulson: Agent Walters.
Walters: Director.
Coulson: How’s the Netherlands?
Walters: Same as always, sir. Lots of bikes, lots of weed. I assume this is about the anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. proposal?
Coulson: We can’t take any chances. Send out the word to your team. Go dark. Seek refuge. Reestablish contact in 24 hours.
Walters: Copy that, sir.
Coulson: And, Agent Walters, stay safe.
Morse: You look good.
Hunter: Oh, yeah? Cheers. And, you know, with the… blond and everything, you don’t look too bad yourself.
Morse: It’s nice of you to say. Because I heard you’ve been telling people I’m a hell beast.
Hunter: Uh… no, I d… I don’t think so. I definitely didn’t use those words specifically. That doesn’t even sound like something I’d say, really. So, you vouched for me, knew I was with S.H.I.E.L.D. the whole time?
Morse: I’m honestly surprised you stayed this long.
Hunter: Well, you know, I’m here for now, but keeping my options open, obviously.
Morse: You always do.
Hunter: If we’re gonna do this now, at least let me grab a beer first.
Morse: I’m gonna go check on May.
May: We’ll be touching down soon.
Morse: Okay.
Morse: You ever been married? Still talk to him? Right. Good advice.
Simmons: Morning, Fitz.
Fitz: Hey. Is that the, uh… hard drive that you stole?
Simmons: Coulson asked me to search it for anything related to the attacks. Um, I was hoping you could help. That is, if you’re not too… I mean…
Fitz: Yeah, um, if you need m-my help, I suppose I’ve got some time.
Simmons: Well, unfortunately, the drive was damaged during our escape. We’ll have to repair it to access any of its i-intel. What?
Fitz: Just, um… You look different. That’s all.
Simmons: Oh.
Fitz: Not “bad” different. Just… Okay…. uh… we probably need to first look at the, uh…
Simmons: The shock sensor.
Fitz: Um, no, the, um…
Simmons: Voice actuator?
Fitz: No, um, Jemma, can you…
Simmons: I’m… I’m sorry.
Fitz: I know. It’s just you said you needed my help. No, I do. Yeah, of course I do. It’s the… micro, uh… this thing here.
Simmons: Oh, yeah. I see. I… see that.
Skye: We need to talk about your brother.
Ward: Which one?
Skye: Your older brother, the senator.
Ward: Christian. Why? What happened?
Skye: Just need basic information… habits, places he frequently visits… stuff like that.
Ward: You need to stay away from him. He’s not what he seems. He always has an angle, and if he thinks that you can lead him to me…
Skye: This isn’t about you.
Ward: Isn’t it? Don’t you remember what happened at the well, what he made me do? He gets joy from one thing… hurting people. So, tell me, please. Does he know I’m here?
Skye: Not how it works, Ward. You answer my questions, remember?
Ward: And I always do. I always tell you the truth, But if Christian knows that I’m here…
Skye: You always tell me the truth?
Ward: Yes. I promised you I’d never lie to you, and I haven’t. What’s this… really about?
Skye: I need information about your brother… people, connections.
Ward: Is this about your father? ‘Cause I wasn’t lying about him. He’s alive, and he’s…
Skye: He’s a murderer. You forgot to mention that detail.
Ward: You found him.
Skye: He didn’t give us what we needed on his brother.
Coulson: Trust me. He gave us more than you think. And you’re slipping off track, Skye. Stay on-mission.
May: Toshiro has the weapons from the U.N. attack, so we have two options. One, firefight. Surprise them, take down as many as we can before they bring out heavy artillery.
Hunter: And option two? Just to hear it.
Morse: I use my HYDRA cover, a cover that could be blown.
May: That’s why I like option one.
Morse: On the other hand, I know Toshiro. The best way to get him to leak intel is to get him bragging. I think it’s worth the risk.
Hunter: She can handle it. Deception’s her forte. Uh, I-I mean that sincerely, not passive-aggressively. As in, it’s a good attribute for a spy to… Bloody hell.
May: You can go in, but if anything’s off, we’re coming after you.
Hunter: They’ll search you for weapons. Don’t die out there, all right?
Hunter: Data intercept’s up and running. We have audio and visual from the security cameras and access to any incoming cellular communications.
Morse: Toshiro-san. (in Japanese) It’s good to see you again.
May: She speaks Japanese?
Hunter: She has this annoying knack for picking things up very quickly.
Toshiro (in Japanese): And you even lightened your hair? Now you really look like a good old Southern girl.
Morse (in Japanese): Would you believe me if I told you I did it for you, Toshiro?
Toshiro: No.
May: Still like option two?
Morse: Do you still have that pan-fired green tea? It’s from the Shizuoka prefecture, right?
Toshiro: You always remember every little detail.
Hunter: Try being married to somebody who remembers every little detail. It’s not that charming. You think I’m being petty, don’t you? Well, I’m not. I don’t have a problem with Bob kissing that guy.
May: Good. Because you had a hickey on your neck for a week after our mission in Miami.
Hunter: Excuse me for doing my job thoroughly… and with style.
Toshiro: The tea needs to steep for at least seven minutes.
Morse: Mm. Perfect time for us to talk business, then.
Toshiro: Forgive me, but I’d like to clear something up first. You see, there’s a nasty rumor going around that you are actually working for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Morse: Toshi, please. Aren’t we all working for S.H.I.E.L.D.? Didn’t you see the papers this morning? Scarlotti and his team were on the front page with that silly eagle on their chests. But those weapons they had… your work, I presume?
Toshiro: How could you tell?
Hunter: This poor sap’s buying every word she says.
May: That’s what we want.
Hunter: I just feel sorry for the guy. Making targets feel special… that’s her thing. You know, when I gave her my nan’s pearl earrings, she was like…
May: You know I don’t like you, right?
Toshiro: I call them splinter bombs. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?
Morse: Is there any way for me to get my hands on a splinter bomb? Those really are a thing of beauty.
Toshiro: Unfortunately, I shipped them all out yesterday. Plus, I can’t take all the credit. Original specs came from HYDRA technology way back when.
Morse: Whitehall gave them to you?
Toshiro: Yes. A leap of faith. I just hope I’ve earned a chance to work on the Diviner.
Morse: The Diviner?
Toshiro: That’s what the lunatic who brought it to him calls it, anyway. I heard it’s alien.
Hunter: You don’t think he means…
May: The Obelisk.
Hunter: Toshiro’s people have an incoming message. Oh, no.
May: What?
Toshiro: All I know is that I have a better case to make once Scarlotti’s team gets to Beckers. Then S.H.I.E.L.D. will be dead in the water.
Morse: They’re en route to Beckers now?
Hunter: You can thank me later.
Morse: Thank you? What the hell were you thinking?
Hunter: What was I thinking? I just saved your life.
Morse: You don’t think I knew that guy was behind me? This… this is just you peacocking.
Hunter: He made you, and he was gonna kill you! And, sweetheart, nobody uses the word “peacocking.”
Morse: Are you even listening to yourself right now? Oh, wait. Of course you are. You love the sound of your own voice.
Hunter: Because it’s reasonable. One of us has to be.
Morse: This is what makes you so aggravating to be with.
Hunter: Hence, not with me anymore. Lucky us.
Morse: Yes.
May: Really?
Hunter: I just saved her life twice, and this is the thanks I get.
May: Toshiro said that they were going after Beckers. Recognize the name?
Morse: Yeah, Julien Beckers, Belgian foreign affairs minister.
Hunter: The guy who’s been keeping the peace?
Morse: If Scarlotti’s team takes out Beckers, even the neutral U.N. countries are gonna fall in line with Senator Ward’s proposal.
May: Call Coulson. We’re heading to Belgium.
Hunter: Bad day to be S.H.I.E.L.D., eh?
Simmons: I still can’t find anything on the weapons. Fitz? Ah, you’re still looking at those backlogged files.
Fitz: Yeah. That’s because, um… those … these two bits, there’s something. I think the…
Simmons: A similar alloy?
Fitz: No, no. No. Um, no. It’s… um… it’s important, because… I… the… Can you stop, uh… stop looking at me?
Simmons: Oh, I can’t even look at you now.
Fitz: No, not like that, you can’t.
Simmons: Like what? I’m… I’m trying not to treat you any differently than…
Fitz: I know, but I am different. And I… and I’m… I’m trying not to be, but I am. And if for some reason you can’t accept it…
Simmons: Oh, that’s not fair. Fitz, I’m only trying to help.
Fitz: You left. I needed help. I needed help with the cloaking. I needed help with, um… with lots of other things, and someone to talk through, at least. You gave up on me.
Simmons: I did no such thing.
Fitz: You told me you were gonna go see your mum and your dad, and then you went off to… for all I… for all I know, you could… something could’ve… you could’ve been killed. And because what? Because you think I’m useless?
Simmons: Of course I don’t. That’s not why I left.
Fitz: Well, then, why?
Simmons: Fitz… I’m sorry. I can’t do this. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Christian Ward: What are you doing here?
Coulson: Don’t worry. I haven’t been waiting long. Phil Coulson. I assume these are for your speech. I made a few changes. It’s funnier now. I’m sure Talbot’s mentioned me from time to time, which is perhaps why you’re trying to call… whomever it is you’re trying to call. Also, your men won’t be checking on you… at least not for the next hour. You’ve requested some “me” time. And who can argue with that?
Christian Ward: What do you want?
Coulson: An opportunity to clear the air. The attack on the U.N. wasn’t S.H.I.E.L.D., it was HYDRA… specifically, a man named Daniel Whitehall.
Christian Ward: You didn’t come here to clear the air. You need something from me. And all this swaggering simply tells me you have nothing to offer in return. What do you want me to do? Go on record defending S.H.I.E.L.D., condemning HYDRA? The American people are looking for a simple enemy, Mr. Coulson. It’s what makes them feel safe.
Coulson: And how do they think they’d feel if they knew your brother was HYDRA? That’s an awfully complicated idea to grasp, especially in an election year.
Christian Ward: Are you threatening me, Mr. Coulson?
Coulson: No. I’m telling you I have your brother in my basement.
Ward: You’re back. Camera’s off. Does Coulson know that…
Skye: Coulson’s out. He cut us off last time, but now nobody’s watching. Just you and me.
Christian Ward: Is he all right? Is Grant hurt? Did… did you have to do anything…
Coulson: No. We believe there are other ways to get information from people. I’m surprised your concerned, honestly.
Christian Ward: You don’t have a brother, do you?
Coulson: No. Always wanted one, though. As an only child, you tend to idealize that relationship. Family has to take care of each other, right? Then again… I’ve heard some stories that say otherwise.
Christian Ward: What did Grant tell you?
Coulson: Plenty. I know what you did. How you forced him to torture your youngest brother. I know what happened at the well.
Christian Ward: So, it’s a well now? You may think you know Grant Ward, Mr. Coulson, but trust me… underneath every lie he tells is just another lie.
Ward: Is Coulson talking to Christian? You can’t trust him. He’ll smile, bare his soul. It is all manipulation. He is a master at it. Look, I know what I am. But my brother… he’s worse.
Christian Ward: When we were kids, our parents were always gone… some state function or another. We’d spend all day by the creek hunting salamanders and crayfish. But I could never leave Grant alone with Thomas. I found Grant down there once, standing over him with a screwdriver. Thomas was on the ground, just screaming. And I saw something… something else behind his eyes. Something I’m sure you’ve seen before, as well. A second later, it was gone, and he was just my little brother again. He told our parents I forced him to do it. I’ve spent too much of my life trying to unravel his lies.
Coulson: So have I.
Christian Ward: And yet, he keeps telling them. He always finds someone to believe him.
Ward: I’m telling you the truth. You see that now, don’t you? I never lied about your father. You just didn’t give me the chance to tell you…
Skye: I know. But I’m giving you the chance now. And I want to know everything.
Coulson: He won’t get away with it this time. It’s not going to be simple… but I think I know a way we can both have what we want.
Ward: Your father killed people, yes. But everything he did, Skye, he did because he loved you. I can’t fault him for that. The people who died in the Hunan province, they weren’t villagers. They were HYDRA agents. They’d found you and your mother.
Skye: My mother? Is she alive, too?
Ward: No. No, they killed her.
Skye: Why?
Ward: I don’t know. But when your father got there, he lost it, tore up the whole village and everyone in it.
Skye: How? What is he?
Ward: Whatever he is, he lost his whole family in one day, and he cracked. But now he wants to put that family back together. I can help with that. I can take you to him.
Skye: How? Where is he?
Ward: I’ve got connections. People I can talk to will track him…
Skye: What connections? What people? Raina’s gone.
Ward: I’m resourceful.
Skye: Then tell me what you know. Isn’t there anything else? Please, Ward.
Ward: No. But we can find him together. I promise you.
Skye: Thank you for telling me everything you know. It’s time we get you out of here.
Ward: Really?
Skye: Really. You’re being transferred, Ward. Your brother wants you in his custody, and we’re gonna give him exactly what he wants.
Coulson: I struck a deal with the senator. He’ll reverse his anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. proposal in exchange for his brother.
May: Long time coming. And Skye?
Skye: I got everything I needed.
May: Good. We’ll touch down in Belgium soon. Try to get to Beckers before Whitehall’s team does.
Coulson: I don’t have to remind you that if he’s killed, the U.N. will come after us no matter what the senator says or does.
May: We’ll be in touch.
Scarlotti: We got Beckers’ location.
Fitz: Yes, theoretically, all those points have to be connected.
Mack: Damn, Fitz. You’re right. You’re right. Ah.
Fitz: Why do you look so surprised? Well… Well, yeah. Well, I’d probably be surprised… Hey, Simmons. The explosives… Mack was just… he saw the, um…
Mack: Yeah, he kept mentioning backlogged files, and, you know, half the stuff he says is nonsense.
Fitz: No, it’s not.
Mack: Check this out. It turns out these bombs are actually from the 1940s, and they were developed by a HYDRA scientist that worked for the Red Skull.
Fitz: The Red Skull. Not nonsense, and designer.
Mack: Yeah, and the actual designer of the bombs is a guy named…
Mack & Fitz: Vincent Beckers.
Simmons: Vincent Beckers. We need to find Coulson… now.
Ward: Listen to me. You can’t trust him.
Coulson: Three and a half weeks. I sat in this chair every day for three and a half weeks, and you never said a word. But now you want to talk? Well, it’s too late.
Ward: Everything I told Skye was true. You know that. I haven’t given you one bad piece of intel. Is that worth nothing?
Coulson: You will never see Skye again.
Ward: I thought we were rebuilding trust, Coulson. I can help you. I’m still a part of your team.
Coulson: My team? You th… You are not nor you’ll ever be on my team. You dropped Fitz-Simmons out of a plane. You murdered Victoria Hand and Eric Koenig. You betrayed every one of us, you deluded son of a bitch. The only reason you’re alive is because you were of use. And the only reason you’re being transferred is because your brother is of more use.
Ward: Was this his idea or yours… to put me on trial? Hmm? It’s a good story… a man brave enough to have his own brother executed for his crimes. Oh, Christian will milk that for all it’s worth. And the trial should wrap up right before the midterms.
Coulson: Your brother saw the same angles. Maybe you two are more alike than you think.
Triplett: Sir, we need you.
Simmons: Vincent Beckers is Julien’s grandfather. We believe the HYDRA connection stayed very much alive.
Skye: We found the travel records for Beckers and Whitehall, and…
Triplett: They coincided at least 12 times over the past five years.
Fitz: That doesn’t make sense.
Mack: Yeah, why would HYDRA be targeting one of their own operatives?
Coulson: We’ve been played. Get May on the line. They need to reroute to our safe house in Bruges.
Walters: Mr. Beckers. We have agents looking for you. How did you find this place?
Beckers: I followed them here.
Triplett: Sir, May’s team’s en route.
Coulson: Oh, no. Whitehall didn’t just want to turn the world against us. He used Beckers as a prop to make our operatives believe his country would provide safe haven, but it’s a trap. They’ll be fish in a barrel.
Walters: What the hell did you do?
Beckers: Mr. Scarlotti, I’ll leave you to what you do best.
Scarlotti: Shame. I prefer to take my time.
Walters: HYDRA will never defeat…
Scarlotti: You were saying?
Hunter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hail HYDRA, guys. Hail HYDRA. I’m unarmed. I’m not looking for any trouble.
Scarlotti: Who sent you?
Hunter: Have you tried the beer around here? This is from Straffe Hendrik, little brewery around the corner. Ask for Zoe. She’ll hook you up. Here, sweetheart, you can have the first one. Looks like you could use it. That face… so dour.
Scarlotti: You got 10 seconds to tell me exactly what you’re doing here.
Hunter: I’m a Merc, mate, like you lot. And if you’re looking to take out a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents higher up the food chain, I happen to know a couple. They just need about… 90 seconds to get in position.
Scarlotti: Huh?
May: I got him.
Scarlotti: All alone?
Hunter: Bobbi!
Hunter: Bob!
Morse: Third time today.
Hunter: What?
Morse: You saved my life.
Coulson: May… how many? Okay. Get home safe.
Simmons: It’s funny. This is where we used to keep the hazardous biological materials.
Mack: Guess not everything changes, huh? What can I do for you?
Simmons: I just wanted to thank you for helping Fitz. Well, for… for being his friend.
Mack: I don’t help him. He doesn’t need any. You know, that guy you’re wishing he would be… I never met him. I only know this guy, and, uh… Yeah, I mean, he’s a little weird, but, uh… but I like him.
Simmons: I don’t want him to be anybody but himself.
Mack: You sure about that?
Simmons: Yes.
Mack: Because I heard he told you how he felt and you bailed.
Simmons: That’s not what happened.
Mack: Look… I know you two have a past. But from what I’ve seen, the only thing that makes him worse… is you.
Simmons: I know. Why do you think I left?
Morse: You’re leaving?
Hunter: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s always been your thing. I won’t stand in the way of that.
Morse: S.H.I.E.L.D.’s not S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore. I’m still trying to figure out where I fit in, too. Just don’t die out there, all right? But if you want to stay… stay.
Coulson: Time to go. Hands.
Christian Ward: Dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen, less than 48 hours ago, brave men and women lost their lives at this very spot I’m standing now, and I think we owe it to them to discuss something all too often elusive… the truth. Sometimes we want things simpler than they actually are, but… the tough reality is, we are complex creatures.
Ward: Skye.
Simmons: If I ever see you again… I’ll kill you.
Christian Ward: And I’ve come to understand something that world must, as well. There is a difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA. One was an organization built on protection, and the other… world domination.
Talbot: We got Beckers at the border. How many men did you lose?
May: Six.
Talbot: It’s always a shame when a good soldier falls.
Christian Ward: And just as good and evil existed side-by-side within S.H.I.E.L.D., the same was true in my own home. At first, I was ashamed to share this truth with the world, but my younger brother, Grant Ward, was a member of HYDRA. He was a traitor. He was a traitor to his friends, his family, and his nation.
Coulson: Do not give him one inch.
Ward: Tell Skye this doesn’t change anything. I’ll keep my promise.
Christian Ward: When evil sits closest to one’s own heart, that is when the surest hand must cut it out. I give my word. I will personally make sure my brother is punished for his crimes. But as is so often true, the darkness lingers longer than the light. And while S.H.I.E.L.D. is gone, HYDRA is a problem that the world must still face. Otherwise, that darkness will grow and spread… and cast a shadow over us all.
Tattoo artist: You got cash this time?
Derik: Tonight, we finish it.
Tattoo artist: It’s gonna hurt. The rest probably hasn’t healed yet. You sure you don’t want to wait a few days?
Derik: The pain helps me remember.
