Schneider: The world is full of people seeking change, hoping to become something else, something better. So my first reaction when I heard that Pete joined the navy was, “you’ve got to be kidding me.“  I mean, this degenerate in the navy? Did they even do a background check? ‘Cause I got two words for you… "Tijuana ‘09.” Yeah, H-bomb knows what I’m talking about.
Woman: Any chance you boys got something stronger behind that bar?
Waiter: Sorry, ma'am, just champagne.
Schneider: But in this case, change is a good thing. Mariya, you are a super-cool chick. And, Pete, you’ll always be my boy. So, everyone, raise your glasses to Pete and Mariya, the Leitners.
All: The Leitners.
Mariya: Aah! Oh my god!
Woman: What’s happening?! Oh! Somebody… somebody help! Please, somebody help! Somebody help us!
Man: Eight went down… dead.
Bakshi: And the others?
Man: Some sick, everyone else scared, but very much alive.
Bakshi: How disappointing. Return immediately to give your report personally. Dr. Whitehall will not be pleased to hear that we, again, have failed.
Triplett: Eight dead, six of them navy.
May: All part of an Anti-HYDRA unit.
Hunter: Any idea what was used to carry out the attack?
Skye: Nope, but the effects appear similar to those from the Obelisk.
May: Which we must assume is in HYDRA’s possession.
May: Heard back from your navy contact?
Coulson: Radio silence.
Skye: Any chance we could find a way in, maybe poke around a bit?
Coulson: Entire fleet’s closing ranks. These were their men. No one other than the CDC and navy’s top brass are setting foot in that room.
Hunter: Okay, then. That’s a dead end.
Triplett: What about Agent Simmons? She’s inside HYDRA. Any chance she has some intel?
Coulson: Still waiting for her to make contact.
Skye: Sir, what is that?
Coulson: Uh, just sketches. If the Obelisk is back in play, we need to know what this writing means. Any progress on your end?
Skye: I put some feelers out to my Rising Tide contacts about the painting we recovered in Miami, and no one has seen anything like it.
Coulson: Keep looking. Something will turn up.
Skye: What about the writings you’ve been giving me? Why don’t you tell me your source, and I’ll follow up?
Coulson: I’m afraid that’s classified.
Hunter: Well, you’re the boss man. Maybe you could de-classify it.
Coulson: I could. I won’t.
Skye: Why not?
Coulson: I already answered the question, Skye.
Skye: No, you didn’t. You skirted it. There’s a difference.
Coulson: Then it’s a difference I’m comfortable with, but if you continue questioning my authority, then you and I are gonna have a very different conversation… one you will not be comfortable with. Is that clear?
Skye: Yes, sir.
May: You know… keeping her in the dark won’t end well.
Cal: If this bullet had struck even half an inch lower, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
Man: Guess today’s my lucky day.
Deacon: And big Rick’s last.
Cal: Please, gentlemen, not in here.
Deacon: Only 'cause you asked nicely.
Raina: I realize this is unexpected.
Deacon: We come to you for discretion, doc. What the hell is this?
Cal: My apologies. This will only take a moment. What did I say about interrupting me at my practice? These men value their privacy.
Raina: I’m in trouble.
Cal: And here I thought you were bringing me good news.
Raina: I need the Obelisk back… temporarily, just until I can make other arrangements.
Cal: And what about ours? After all these years, I thought you’d show more respect.
Raina: Please, I beg you. Don’t beg.
Cal: It reminds me of what you were when I found you… Hungry, in the streets, with just those fairy tales your grandmother told you.
Raina: You said you’d make them come true.
Cal: You said you’d bring me my girl.
Raina: And I did.
Cal: You brought me a picture and a promise. I still only have the picture. Who wants it? Who has made you this afraid, Raina?
Raina: Daniel Whitehall.
Cal: He scares you more than I do?
Raina: No, please. He’s very powerful.
Cal: Mm.
Raina: He has resources.
Cal: He’s a butcher!
Raina: And what are you?!
Cal: I’m a man trying to put my family back together!
Raina: You’re losing control again. You need me. You’re barely holding it together. If you’re not careful, you’ll… you’ll lose Skye forever. If she sees you like this…
Cal: It doesn’t matter. I’ll never see her if you never bring her to me.
Raina: I’m the only one who… who can. And I can’t… breathe.
Cal: It’s the only thing that will make her understand… understand me. I won’t turn it over. I’m sorry.
Raina: Daniel Whitehall will cut me to pieces.
Cal: Yes. He will. I suggest you go back to his office and beg to him. Maybe he’s turned soft in his old age.
Raina: I really wanted to bring you Skye.
Cal: That’s not her name.
Deacon: Hey, doc. Can we please finish up here? And for god’s sakes, man, try to keep it together.
Simmons: What sort of hell cow produces carmine milk?
Turgeon: I don’t know. File just says “Bessie.”
Bakshi: You two, come with me.
Bakshi: Look these over.
Turgeon: Oh, my god.
Simmons: W-What is it?
Turgeon: W… that’s Daniel Whitehall. One of HYDRA’s new heads.
Whitehall: Good day. I’ve brought you here because I need your help.
Lingenfelter: We recently attempted to reverse engineer the effects of an alien artifact using tissue samples from one of its victims.
Whitehall: Unfortunately, the results were less than what we’d hoped for.
Lingenfelter: There were positives. Many of the deceased were enemies of HYDRA.
Whitehall: Some of us are pleased with these small triumphs. Others have loftier aspirations… passion, even. Our founder… he had his tesseract. As for me, well, it would be an understatement to say that I’ve waited my whole life to get possession of the Obelisk, to harness its power. Dr. Simmons, is it?
Simmons: Yes.
Whitehall: Bakshi tells me you have a passion for these things yourself. In your opinion, where did Dr. Lingenfelter go wrong?
Simmons: I-I’m not entirely sure that she did.
Whitehall: That’s one among us. Please, clarify.
Simmons: Well, it… it’s just we’re dealing with alien technology. Alien metals interact with biology on a cellular level in a way that’s impossible to replicate without a sample.
Whitehall: But if we were to acquire the Obelisk itself, would it then be possible to weaponize its effects?
Simmons: I would think so, yes.
Whitehall: Excellent. I want everyone prepared when we do.
Turgeon: He knows your name.
Simmons: Do you have any idea what this means? We could kill millions of people, perhaps even billions.
Turgeon: Pretty awesome, huh?
Hunter: Don’t mind me just standing here.
Fitz: Did Skye just steal that painting from our lab?
Simmons: Mack certainly has an impressive physique, wouldn’t you say?
Fitz: Bugger off.
Simmons: No. It’s true. Look at him. He’s quite a lot of a man.
Fitz: Well, obviously I agree, what with you being my subconscious and everything. What? I can say that to you. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a casual observation. That’s all it is.
Simmons: No, I know that.
Fitz: Yeah. Well, why are you still staring at me?
Simmons: Because you just admitted that I’m not real.
Fitz: Oh, please. I’m not gonna have this conversation with myself again.
Simmons: Fitz, this is a good thing. You’ve got friends now, real friends. You don’t need me anymore.
Fitz: Yeah, but I miss you. I mean, I still… miss her.
Simmons: But she left and moved on. Maybe it’s time you do the same.
Hunter: I was a fat baby.
Skye: You know this is, like, a religious painting, right?
Hunter: Yeah, well, when aliens started scribbling on the back of it, it kind of voided god’s warranty, as far as I’m concerned.
Skye: I just wish I knew what that scribbling meant.
Hunter: The director won’t be much help.
Skye: Do you think I was wrong to press?
Hunter: No, on the contrary, couldn’t agree more. Reminded me of how I used to put the screws to my old lady.
Skye: It’s not like that.
Hunter: No? Then why put yourself in Coulson’s cross hairs?
Skye: Because Coulson used to be different. He wasn’t always so closed off.
Hunter: I’m telling you, my ex was the same way… always keeping secrets. Drove me absolutely mental. There really is only one way to handle people like that. Dig deeper. Invade their privacy till they go crazy themselves.
Skye: Wow. Thanks for the advice, divorced guy.
Hunter: All I’m saying is there’s something Coulson doesn’t want you to know. Maybe you should find out what it is.
Skye: And how do you suggest I do that?
Hunter: Well, don’t know exactly. But it seems your HYDRA boyfriend downstairs would be a good place to start.
Ward: I’m surprised it took you so long.
Skye: This isn’t about that.
Ward: Come on, Skye. Don’t pretend you haven’t thought about what I said.
Skye: Yeah, well, I’m pretty sure you’re the last person I’d ever want to talk to about my father.
Ward: Not if you want to find him.
Skye: My parents were killed in the Hunan province, along with everyone else in their village.
Ward: That’s not what happened.
Skye: I know what you’re doing.
Ward: I’m just trying to help.
Skye: No, you’re exploiting a weakness, looking for a way in.
Ward: I told you… I will never lie to you… not again.
Skye: Okay. If you’re really being honest, name your source.
Ward: What?
Skye: If you have information about my father, tell me where it came from… it’s that simple.
Ward: Raina. She knows him, Skye.
Skye: No, I believe that you think she does. Oh. Do you not get it? Raina played you. She found your weakness and then used it against you.
Ward: Skye…
Skye: Shut up, Ward. I don’t want to hear you say another word about it. Good. Tell me what you know about this.
Ward: I first saw that when we were in Belarus… me and you… and later on, when Garrett started etching that in the glass.
Skye: Garrett carved this stuff himself? Did he say what it was?
Ward: No, but he wasn’t making a lot of sense after he was injected with the GH-formula. These writings… they’re not yours, are they? Good. That’s good, 'cause once Garrett started, he couldn’t stop. The writing was anywhere he could carve it… on the walls, on the floor.
Skye: On his desk.
Ward: To be honest, I was almost relieved when S.H.I.E.L.D. put him down. The Garrett I knew was long gone once the writing started. And whatever took his place, I don’t think it was meant to survive.
Simmons: HYDRA pursuing alien WMD technology. Must act quickly to prevent extinction-level event. Awaiting further instructions. Fish tacos.
Skye: The reason you won’t name your source is because you are the source.
Coulson: By all means, come on in.
Skye: Please, I know it’s you, so just be honest with me. Are you okay?
Coulson: I’m fine.
Skye: Because once Garrett started writing, he went kind of nuts.
Coulson: I see you’ve been talking to Ward. I told you… I’m fine. May’s been keeping an eye on me.
Skye: When did you start doing this?
Coulson: First night I saw Garrett’s writings… it just triggered something in me.
Skye: What do you think caused it?
Coulson: The GH-formula, most likely. Garrett and I were both injected… not a coincidence.
Skye: Yeah, but so was I, and I haven’t written anything like that.
Coulson: Which is either very good, or a whole different kind of scary, which is why we had to monitor you.
Skye: Whoa. Wait. Monitor? That is a very specific word.
Coulson: We didn’t tell you about this because we wanted to passively observe… see if the writing would trigger something in you.
Skye: So, what… you guys put, like, tiny hidden cameras in my bunk?
Coulson: Not in your bunk, but I think you’re focusing on the wrong details here.
Skye: I didn’t react the same way.
Coulson: Right. I believe Garrett and I had a negative reaction to the alien DNA in our system. Maybe you didn’t… because it was already there.
Skye: Yeah, right, like I’m an alien. Hold on. Are you saying that I am an alien?
Coulson: It’s a theory…
Skye: No, a theory is what scientists use to prove things in nature. This is you telling me that I might be an alien! That is not something you just say like it is no big deal.
Coulson: I was trying not to rattle you.
Skye: Well, guess what… epic fail.
May: Coulson, you have a call on line 1.
Coulson: Really not a good time.
May: You’re gonna want to take this call.
Coulson: Hello.
Raina: I hope I’m not interrupting.
Coulson: Somehow, I suspect that’s the point. What do you want, Raina?
Raina: To meet. You and I have something to discuss, Agent Coulson. The matter is quite urgent.
Bakshi: Everyone, listen up. I need each of you to step away from your desk and place your hands behind your back.
Morse: Keep everyone off their phones and tablets. We have a mole, ladies and gentlemen, right here in our very facility. Someone has been sending S.H.I.E.L.D. messages right under our noses. I specialize in finding them. Bakshi here… well, he makes them suffer. Until that happens… no one leaves.
Bakshi: HYDRA does not tolerate traitors. Anyone caught in possession of contraband will be punished accordingly.
Morse: Dr. Jemma Simmons. This is quite an impressive résumé… S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, top of your class, two PHDs in very advanced fields. It even says here you spent time in the field as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Is that correct?
Simmons: Only a short time.
Morse: No. You’ve only been in HYDRA a short time. But it seems that you’ve been affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D. in one capacity or another for most of your life.
Simmons: To be fair, aren’t most HYDRA agents ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives?
Morse: Who were working from within S.H.I.E.L.D. long before it fell. But there’s no evidence you supported HYDRA while S.H.I.E.L.D. still existed. In fact, it seems you were an exemplary S.H.I.E.L.D. agent… perhaps even still are.
Simmons: My loyalties are with HYDRA.
Morse: I’ll be the judge of that.
Agent: Madam… there’s something you have to see.
Turgeon: Wait. Wait. That’s… That’s not mine. I-I-I’ve never seen that before in my life! I don’t even know what that is! What… I…
Hunter: Still nothing.
May: Copy that.
Chef: You ask too much. My food… it suffers from this intrusion.
Skye: We have been over this. You and your staff will be well compensated for your help.
May: Incoming at 4:00.
Hunter: The tiny girl in the flower dress? That’s who everyone’s making such a fuss about?
Raina: It’s good to see you, Agent Coulson.
Coulson: Raina.
Raina: I was worried you weren’t going to accept my invitation… but perhaps I wasn’t the only one looking forward to our next meeting.
Hunter: Is she hitting on him?
Skye: Yep.
May: That’s what she does.
Coulson: You implied there was something urgent to discuss, so here I am. Either way, you’re gonna give me what I want.
Raina: You’ve changed, Agent Coulson.
Coulson: Might just be circumstance, considering last time, you had me strapped into your little memory machine.
Raina: I was only trying to help.
Coulson: You want to help? Tell me where to find the Obelisk.
Raina: I’m afraid it’s out of my hands.
Coulson: That really doesn’t work for me. I’ve seen what that thing can do. It’s too dangerous to be out in the real world.
Raina: You’ve only seen the beginning. Just because something’s powerful doesn’t make it dangerous.
Coulson: In this case, it’s more the death and destruction.
Raina: You must believe me, Agent Coulson… we want the same thing.
Coulson: Unless it’s an end to this conversation, I’m pretty sure we don’t.
Raina: You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Coulson: Only when I suspect she has something up her sleeve.
Raina: It’s in my purse, actually. Right now, HYDRA’s looking for a spy within their ranks. I wonder what would happen to Agent Simmons… if this were to fall into the wrong hands.
Simmons: Everything will be just fine.
Morse: Don’t you seem nervous?
Simmons: Well, maybe it has something to do with you lurking right outside of my stall.
Morse: Bakshi informed me that you and Kenneth were lab partners.
Simmons: We’d worked together on a couple of assignments, yes.
Morse: Well, there are some who believe that he may not have been acting alone. Were you colluding with Kenneth?
Simmons: No.
Morse: Did you plant the flex screen on Kenneth’s desk?
Simmons: No.
Morse: You’re not a very good liar, are you? Maybe I should take a look at your hard drive, see what I find.
Simmons: Go right ahead. It’s nothing but HYDRA files.
Morse: Oh, it better be. I want you to keep something in mind, Agent Simmons… HYDRA is everywhere. Carry on.
Coulson: I don’t like being threatened.
Raina: This isn’t a threat. It’s a gesture of goodwill. I would like nothing more than to delete that photo.
Coulson: And in return, what do you want?
Raina: From you? Nothing. But I will need to take Skye with me.
Coulson: Excuse me? What in the hell is this really about? And why, also in the hell, do you think I would ever let that happen?
Raina: To prevent every HYDRA employee from receiving an automated e-mail with that photo. You have two minutes, after which, there’s nothing I can do.
Coulson: Where are you planning to take Skye?
Raina: Somewhere she’s always wanted to go… to meet her dad.
May: She’s lying.
Skye: Ward said Raina knew him. This cannot be a coincidence.
Coulson: So you’re what… working for Skye’s father now?
Raina: I’m just trying to make the best out of a difficult situation.
Coulson: By threatening the life of one of my agents?
Raina: By allowing one to find out who she really is. That’s what Skye’s been searching for her whole life. Ask her yourself, Agent Coulson. She’s here, isn’t she… listening? Skye needs to know that her father loves her very much, that she was taken from him against his will, that he’s spent her entire life searching for her. No matter how much you’ve changed, Agent Coulson, deep down, you’re still a good man. No good man would intentionally keep a daughter from her father… especially when so much is at stake. You’re running out of time. Give Skye what she’s always wanted… or else Agent Simmons dies.
Coulson: No deal.
May: Stand down, Skye.
Skye: Were you not listening? If I don’t go out there, Simmons is gonna die.
May: Coulson has a plan.
Skye: He also carves alien writing into his desk, so maybe his judgment is not what it used to be.
May: I said stand down.
Raina: Look, it’s not too late. We can fix this. No one needs to get hurt. Please.
Bakshi: There she is. Grab her!
Simmons: Oh, no.
Simmons: What is happening?
Morse: Don’t worry. Coulson has a plan.
Raina: I can’t believe you would sacrifice one of your own agents.
Coulson: We all take risks in this business. In your case, it just didn’t pay off.
Raina: I had no choice.
Hunter: Tiny violin’s playing, but no one’s listening, sweetheart.
Coulson: Who’s making you do this?
Raina: HYDRA.
Coulson: They want the Obelisk, but you don’t have it. Skye’s father does.
Raina: He won’t stop until he gets her.
Coulson: You’re scared of him… and you don’t scare easily.
Raina: He’s a very dangerous man. You wouldn’t believe the stories.
Hunter: Well, now we’ve established Skye’s old man isn’t father of the year, what’s next?
Raina: Take me in. Please.
Coulson: Sorry. No vacancies.
Raina: Once I walk out that door, Whitehall will kill me.
Coulson: It’s possible. Or… maybe you and I will work together after all.
Raina: What?
Hunter: Tag and tail it is, then.
Raina: You’re gonna use me to get to Whitehall.
Coulson: He’ll be trying to find you. Whether or not we’re there to save you when he does, that’s your call, depending on how useful you make yourself. You can start by telling us how to find Skye’s father.
Simmons: I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, because I am truly grateful, but who are you?
Morse: Bobbi Morse. Coulson sent me in to infiltrate HYDRA and keep an eye on you.
Simmons: Well, you did a spot-on job, really. You were quite intimidating.
Morse: Sorry about that. I had to assess other security issues that were in play.
Simmons: Yeah, like every HYDRA agent receiving an e-mail blowing my cover?
Morse: Yeah, that was a curve ball.
Simmons: I’m afraid there’s no way I’m walking out that front door.
Morse: Okay, don’t worry. All we have to do is get to the roof. There’s already an extraction team there waiting. Okay, just wait here. It’s all part of the plan. All right?
Morse: We’ve been compromised. I need you to abandon your post and follow protocol 6-8-5.
Man: It’s her.
Morse: I told you there was a plan.
Simmons: I know. I’m sorry, but…
Morse: Okay, go get to the roof. Go.
Simmons: Where are they? We’re trapped.
Morse: Southwest corner! Repeat, Southwest corner! Get down!
Morse: Run!
Simmons: There’s no one there!
Triplett: Welcome back, Agent Simmons.
Simmons: Trip, it’s so good to see you. You certainly know how to make a first impression, Agent Morse.
Morse: Please, it’s just Bobbi.
Simmons: Forgive me for asking, but if you were able to infiltrate HYDRA, why even bother having me go in?
Morse: My cover gave me access to HYDRA security, but none of its high-level projects.
Simmons: Then I’m afraid I came up empty-handed.
Morse: Not entirely.
Simmons: My hard drive.
Morse: I took it after our conversation in the bathroom. Seemed like it might provide some useful intel.
Simmons: Oh. I like you.
Triplett: Cargo’s on board, and we’ve cleared HYDRA airspace.
Man: Copy that, SHIELD-218.
Triplett: Hey, you.
Morse: Hey.
Man: Course is set. Proceed back to base.
Hunter: You ask me, Coulson let you off easy.
Raina: I didn’t ask.
Hunter: Good luck out there, love.
May: The address Raina gave us is only a few blocks away.
Coulson: And I thought she chose this place for the ambiance.
May: Remember what Lumley said about Skye?
Coulson: “Wherever she goes, death follows?” Yeah, that was a memorable quote.
May: Look, we know Skye’s father has been searching for her all this time. What if he’s what Lumley is so afraid of?
Hunter: Probably a trap, isn’t it?
Coulson: Could be. I’ll need you running surveillance. May, check the scanners. Make sure local P.D. aren’t patrolling the area. And, Skye… Where’s Skye?
Skye: Hello? Anyone here? You wanted to meet. Well, here I am. Where did you go?
Coulson: So he was here.
Skye: Yeah. I just wanted a glimpse.
Coulson: You’re having one hell of a day, huh? We’ll find him. It’s okay. It’s okay.
Hunter: So, is this a group-hug-type situation?
Coulson: You find anything?
Hunter: The place has been cleared out… Must have left in a hurry. Agent May’s checking the back room.
Skye: Have you been drinking?
Hunter: I was working. Had to maintain my cover.
Skye: Your cover as what… Ron Burgundy?
Hunter: I can see why she frustrates you.
Coulson: Agent May, any sign of him?
May: No. But there’s something you need to see.
May: Looks like a small blade, probably a scalpel. And this is just pure strength. Whoever did this…
Skye: We all know who did this.
Skye: Look at what he did. I can’t believe it.
Cal: No, no, no….
Skye: He’s a…
Cal: Monster.
Triplett: This is SHIELD-218, asking permission to land.
Man: You’re cleared for landing, SHIELD-218.
Coulson: Welcome home, Agent Simmons.
Simmons: Director Coulson.
Coulson: I’m glad to have you back.
Simmons: I’m just glad to be alive. If it hadn’t have been for Agent Morse, I…
Morse: Bobbi.
Simmons: Bobbi, right. If it hadn’t have been for Bobbi, I would never have made it out. Probably be brainwashed, happy to comply to who knows what. She’s amazing.
Coulson: That’s why I’ve asked her to join the team. Go ahead. Agents Triplett, Morse.
Simmons: Hi, Fitz.
Fitz: Simmons… Is that really you?
Simmons: Of course it is. Who else would it be? How’ve you been?
Morse: Thank you.
Mack: Hey. Long time, no see, Barbara.
Morse: Don’t start with that again. Hey. Aww.
Mack: What you been up to?
Morse: Oh, you know, working undercover at HYDRA, acting all uptight and evil.
Mack: Mm-hmm.
Morse: You know what I could really go for right now?
Mack: Three-olive martini.
Mack & Morse: Hold the olives.
Mack: Yeah.
Hunter: Bobbi?
Morse: Hey, Hunter. Nice suit.
Hunter: “Nice suit?” Really? That’s what you’re leading with? What did you do to your hair?
Morse: Ever heard of undercover?
Hunter: I prefer you blonde.
Morse: Well, I didn’t do it for you. Two seconds in… there’s already a tone.
Hunter: Th-this isn’t a tone. This is my speaking voice when I’m upset with an unreasonable person.
Triplett: What’s the deal there?
May: Hunter ever tell you stories about his she-devil ex-wife?
Triplett: All the time… Damn.
Hunter: Anyone mind telling me what the bloody hell she’s doing here?
Coulson: Bobbi’s one of our best agents.
Hunter: Oh, that’s rich! Then mind telling me what I’m doing here?
Morse: It’s easy… I vouched for you.
Hunter: Why the hell would you do that?!
Coulson: Play nice.
Skye: It’s good to have Simmons back.
Coulson: Which is why you should be down there.
Skye: I know you’re gonna go after him.
Coulson: Skye…
Skye: No, it’s okay. I get it. He’s a bad guy. And right now he has the Obelisk, which is a bad thing. You know, I’ve spent all my life wondering who he was and why he left. But after today, I-I just don’t care anymore. All I care about is that we stop him, and I just wanted to let you know that whatever it takes to do that, I’m in.
Coulson: That’s good to know.
Skye: If we’re gonna do this, you have to be completely honest with me from now on… no more secrets, no more compartmentalization, and definitely no more hidden cameras. Whatever’s going on, you bring me in… no exceptions.
Coulson: Okay.
Skye: Okay.
Coulson: We should probably get started.
Skye: So, this is what you’ve been doing up here.
Coulson: Well, it’s what I did yesterday.
Skye: You’re kidding.
Coulson: I don’t know how else to explain it, but it needs to be carved.
Skye: Does… does it just appear in your mind, like some sort of vision?
Coulson: No. It just… kind of happens, which is really frustrating because no matter how much I carve, it still means nothing to me. I don’t even have a theory.
Skye: I do. It’s a map.
Bakshi: The lab should be dismantled within the hour.
Whitehall: And the rest of the facility?
Bakshi: Not long after.
Cal: I couldn’t help but notice all the moving boxes. I’m sorry for the interruption. This will only take a second.
Bakshi: Remove him!
Cal: Please, lower your voice. Let’s all… Let’s all try and keep our heads about us. Let’s all try and stay calm. Mm. Sorry. Let’s all try and keep our heads about us. I hear you’ve been looking for this.
Whitehall: The Obelisk.
Cal: In its native language, it’s called the Diviner, one of many little details I know about this thing.
Whitehall: Can you tell me how to use it?
Cal: Better yet, I’ll teach you how to survive it.
Whitehall: And why would you do that?
Cal: We share a common enemy… a guy named Phil Coulson. I thought maybe together, you and I could kill him… along with, you know, everyone else.
