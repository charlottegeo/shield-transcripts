Billy: What’s up… What’s up with you and all the spawn kills?
Sam: It’s called “black ops” for a reason, Billy.

Sam: How was your flight, sir?
Coulson: Another middle seat. But I remembered to bring you this.
Sam: Oh. Sweet. Thank you, sir. Hope they never go out of business. So, Simmons is adjusting nicely to HYDRA.
Coulson: She’s tougher than she looks. Skye’s doing well in her training with May, And Trip’s on board full-time.
Sam: Well, what about the new recruits? Billy says that Hartley and Hunter keep drinking all of his beer.
Coulson: Not surprised to hear that. Any update on Agent Gonzales?
Sam: Unfortunately, no. There’s a pretty good chance that HYDRA took him out.
Coulson: Keep looking.
Sam: And, uh… Fitz? Any progress?
Coulson: Some.
Sam: Does May still think you’re on a recruiting trip to London?
Coulson: She does, which is why I don’t have a lot of time here.
Sam: Okay. Well, sir, first, you are going to need…
Coulson: A lanyard. Yes, I do.
Sam: Blue and gray. Subtle, masculine, gels nicely with the new triangular design.
Coulson: What are we calling this, anyway?
Sam: The Theta Protocol, sir.
Coulson: “Theta Protocol.” I need you to write that down for me.
Sam: I gotta tell you, it’s not easy to keep something as big like Helicarrier in secret.
Coulson: Cards on the table.
Gonzales: Obviously, you and Fury have been keeping busy.
Coulson: What can I say? I’m a company man. [i]With the fall of SHIELD, Fury felt we needed a failsafe, something completely off the books, a “break in case of emergency” type of thing.
Weaver: Seems like you broke it wide open.
Morse: And saved the day in the process.
Coulson: What’s transpired over the last week is a lot to take in. I know. When I found out that this ship had survived HYDRA’s attack and still had that classified cargo onboard, that you placed spies on my base, that I couldn’t keep my own people safe. I felt like I’d failed as director. And the truth is, I did. A coup will make you think about things like that. I tried to do it all alone. That was a mistake. Even Fury had a World Council watching over him, providing guidance.
Gonzales: What are you suggesting?
Coulson: One SHIELD, where I operate as director, under your advisement. This way, we’ll have a cool underground base and a boat.
Gonzales: It’s hard to argue with a man who prevented Ultron from killing thousands of people. But there are plenty more battles to be won, and one closer to home that I fear the Helicarrier won’t solve.
Fitz: She’s been in there every day. You think she’ll stay when he wakes up?
Simmons: She says she wants to take him home, whatever that means. She won’t say much else about it, not to me, anyway. You can go ahead and take that off now, Agent Palamas. Thanks. Hmm. Your brain scans look rather normal, considering.
Kara: What does that mean?
Simmons: Well, you’ll still have some memory gaps, obviously, but any part of the HYDRA indoctrination that was affecting your actions is gone. Your mind’s your own again.
Kara: Thank you, both of you. Honestly, I think knowing Bakshi’s gone has helped more than anything. You know as well as I do what a monster he was. You were undercover at HYDRA with Agent Morse, weren’t you?
Simmons: Well, sort of. I didn’t know she was there at the time. She had very dark hair. But she did save my life when it came…
Skye: Hi. It’s okay. I’m here. You’re safe now. Added bonus, you’re not naked with needles poking out of your skin.
Lincoln: Skye, why are we… No.
Skye: Oh. Uh… uh, it’s okay. You can trust them. They’re my friends. They helped save you.
Lincoln: You never should have come for me.
Skye: I had to. Jiaying wouldn’t allow it if I…
Lincoln: There’s a reason for that. The only thing that’s kept us safe all these years is that we were a secret. Now SHIELD knows we exist. And they won’t stop till they find Afterlife.
Michael: Blue light? Really?
Raina: Spilling out of your son, from every pore. He’ll go through the mist when he comes of age, Michael, and he’ll be beautiful.
Michael: Thank you.
Gordon: You’re looking very well.
Raina: You were right. It is a gift, all of it. I just needed to embrace it, embrace my life here, my purpose to help my people.
Gordon: Your vision of the devastation of Sokovia has proved your value to all of us. Have you had any more visions?
Raina: All the time now. I’m starting to feel at peace, less fraught with fear and pain. Though sometimes, it’s hard to tell what’s a vision and what’s a dream.
Gordon: Well, maybe I can help.
Raina: Last night, I saw something beautifully peculiar. It’s hard to describe. It was a giant stone, but not a stone. And then, suddenly it was like an ocean, waves crashing against the shore.
Gordon: Hold on. This stone, were there deep cavities carved into it?
Raina: How did you know?
Jiaying: This could mean the end of us. I don’t understand.
Raina: Have you come across this before?
Jiaying: Only through stories passed down by our ancestors. It’s Kree, dangerous, intended to destroy our people.
Raina: But didn’t they make us?
Jiaying: Then they decided we were a mistake. Gordon, do you think you could locate it, confirm it exists?
Gordon: If it’s Kree, I suppose I could find a connection to tether. But it’ll only put me in the vicinity.
Raina: Maybe I could help. If I see the place, I’ll know it.
Gordon: It will be easier if we’re together.
Jiaying: Go. Find it.
Raina: This is it. It’s here.
Gordon: Does any of this look familiar?
Raina: No. I remember a red door.
Morse: Thought you’d be happier. Or at least content. Things are getting back to the way they were.
May: You really believe that? Or do you hope that if you forgive Coulson, Hunter will do the same for you?
Jiaying: You said Raina’s manipulative. But is she dangerous?
Cal: That depends on how you define “dangerous.”
Jiaying: She convinced Gordon and Skye to go after Lincoln even though they knew it wasn’t safe.
Cal: Daisy’s strong. She gets that from you. But if she’s not okay, I will personally rip out Raina’s little, tainted rat heart! Or not. W-Whatever you want.
Jiaying: Who was she when you first met her?
Cal: She had nothing. No family, no home. Somehow, she convinced this café owner to bring her old pastries, persuaded a tailor to give her leftover fabric so she could make dresses.
Jiaying: Resourceful.
Cal: Selfish. Soon, she demanded the warm, fresh pastries, not the stale ones. If they were willing to give her cotton, why not silk? I’ve never seen her not want something.
Jiaying: What is it you think she wants now?
Raina: I’ve envied you because Jiaying needs you. You bring people in and out of Afterlife. I’m just an annoyance.
Gordon: Oh, that’s not true. Your gift is incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it.
Raina: But I wasn’t chosen. Why does she bring so few through the mist?
Hunter: Stop! Holy…
Coulson: It’s the teleporter.
Gonzales: They’re going for the cargo on the lower deck.
Gordon: They know we’re here. We need to go.
Raina: Gordon, this is it.
Gordon: Wait. It’s not safe.
Gonzales: Should have destroyed it when we had the chance.
Morse: You know we couldn’t risk it.
Weaver: There were too many variables.
May: So this is alien.
Gonzales: Recovered from a dig site nearly a hundred years ago.
Weaver: Its energy signatures are unlike anything we’ve seen before.
Hunter: Mm. And does anyone have any idea what alien world it came from or what it even does? Oh, this new S.H.I.E.L.D. brain trust seems to be working out brilliantly.
Gonzales: Anything about it in Fury’s toolbox?
Coulson: Just that HYDRA was looking for it.
Morse: Well, now you have a new interested party.
Gonzales: The question is, why?
Skye: I have no idea. Seriously, I have never heard of anything like that before, and neither has Lincoln.
Coulson: And you believe him?
Skye: Why wouldn’t I?
Coulson: You barely know him.
Skye: I know enough. He and Jiaying helped me. They never tried to hurt me. Th-They taught me to channel my power so I wasn’t hurting myself. These are good people, Coulson.
Coulson: Are they? People, I mean. Look, I know you feel connected to this group, but you won’t tell us much about them, you’re keeping to yourself…
Skye: I’ve been taking care of Lincoln.
Coulson: Okay, but from our perspective, we don’t even know what to call them.
Skye: Inhumans. Our ancient ancestors called themselves Inhumans, and we just want to be left alone.
Coulson: We?
May: If they want to be left alone, then why infiltrate a military vessel?
Skye: You’re assuming that this thing is a weapon. Well, it’s in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s possession. Maybe they’re just afraid of it, afraid of what Gonzales might do with it.
Coulson: We’re not the enemy here.
May: This man teleported onboard, Skye. He’s clearly very dangerous.
Skye: Well, same could be said about you, May. I heard about what happened to that little girl in Bahrain. Jiaying told me the whole story. Did you know that she was inhuman? They both were. So you, of all people, should understand why they’d want to keep their location a secret. What they’re so afraid of.
Morse: Cargo hold’s secure. Or as secure as it can be with a teleporter in the mix.
Gonzales: We no longer have to wait for the Inhumans to come to us.
Oliver: Remember how HYDRA could track the teleporter?
Weaver: I was able to rebuild that device using this scan from Deathlok’s eye.
Morse: What are you saying?
Oliver: When the teleporter left the cargo hold…
Weaver: We were able to follow his signature.
Morse: You know where they are?
Gonzales: We do. I think it’s time we pay our new friends a visit.
Gonzales: What’s our plan of attack?
Coulson: Who said anything about an attack?
Gonzales: These people are a threat.
Morse: We don’t know that.
Gonzales: We don’t know anything about them.
Weaver: Except for the fact that they found our base and our aircraft carrier.
Oliver: They could teleport into this room right now and leave a bomb behind.
Weaver: We’ve seen what Skye’s capable of. Lincoln could short out our entire system.
Coulson: I understand your concerns, but the last thing we need is to start a war. We just finished one, for God’s sake.
Gonzales: Action needs to be taken, Phil.
Coulson: Which is why I’m proposing a sit-down with their leader, this woman Jiaying. We’ll call it a fact-finding mission.
Weaver: They’d need to agree to that first.
Morse: We could use Skye as a liaison. She is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Gonzales: Is that still true?
Coulson: Of course it is.
May: Now’s a good time to find out where Skye really stands.
Jiaying: So they do have it.
Gordon: Deep in their ship, under lock and key.
Raina: For now.
Cal: Sounds like somebody knows something we don’t.
Gordon: Jiaying, this doesn’t concern him.
Cal: Yes. Yes, it does. Our daughter is probably still with S.H.I.E.L.D. Or did you forget that you dropped her off at their doorstep?!
Raina: Cal, don’t lose your head.
Cal: Oh, come off it. This little act, it’s so transparent. Now you’re… you’re going to help “your people,” protect them with your “visions?” How do we know that you’re not just making this stuff up?
Gordon: Everything she’s seen has come true.
Cal: This power that she has… it lets her control you.
Raina: What do you think I’m trying to do?
Cal: Oh, huh, I don’t know. Create chaos?
Raina: Why would I do that?
Cal: Because you thrive on it!
Gordon: Back off.
Jiaying: Cal, please…
Gordon: What are you gonna do, Cal? Without that concoction that you take, you’re nothing. What’s in those vials, anyway? Muscle milk?
Jiaying: Enough! S.H.I.E.L.D. wants us to be afraid, to fracture. But we’re all tied together, a history that goes back thousands of years. They will not take that away from us.
Skye: No, you cannot go there. Listen, secrecy is what they value most.
Coulson: We can’t ignore their existence. They’re not ignoring ours.
Skye: Please!
Coulson: Look, at the very least, we need to find out how many people we’re dealing with, assess their powers, place them on the index. You know how this works. You’re a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Skye: I-I don’t know what I am anymore. Okay, just let Lincoln and I go first. They’re probably worried about us. I’ll talk to Jiaying, explain why you’re coming, that you just want to help. She’ll listen.
Coulson: How can you be sure?
Skye: Because she’s my mother.
Morse: We’re locking her up?
May: Don’t tell me you empathize.
Morse: She was one of us.
May: So was Grant Ward. Look, when she takes your face, then we can talk.
Morse: Hmm. Shouldn’t do that without a spotter.
Mack: My spotter’s always late.
Morse: Needed to practice my speech.
Mack: Nothing you say is gonna change my mind, Barbara.
Morse: Things could be different, you know. Sometimes, anarchy brings order.
Mack: My favorite idealist. You talk to Hunter yet?
Morse: He still hasn’t looked me in the eye. About three days after that, he’ll be ready to talk.
Mack: You two are messed up.
Morse: Says the guy who put him in a choke hold. Though he’s been pretty quick to forgive you.
Mack: He’s using me to piss you off. You know that, right?
Morse: Hunter’s always worn his heart on his sleeve. I don’t know how to do that. Maybe something’s wrong with me. I think I’m up.
May: I miss my plane.
Coulson: Me, too. Though, if you think about it, mostly terrible stuff happened on that thing. I spoke to Skye. This woman she keeps talking about, Jiaying, it’s her mother. I was expecting at least a raised eyebrow, but okay.
May: I’ll tell the Council.
Coulson: May, I thought now would be a good time to apologize to you, at length, as promised.
May: There’s no need.
Coulson: Fury and I felt…
May: We don’t owe each other anything.
Coulson: Hey. That’s not true. Look, if this is about what Skye said…
May: It’s not.
Coulson: Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care what happened in Bahrain.
May: Yes, you do. Or you wouldn’t bring it up. That girl wasn’t killed in the crossfire, Phil.
Coulson: Okay.
May: It was her or everyone around us, and I made the call. I only told Andrew. Back then, our boundaries were clear. I was married to him, and I worked with you.
Coulson: Melinda…
May: When you started carving into that wall, you asked me to watch you and put you down if you got out of control. I would never have shot you, but I should have stopped you.
Coulson: I never lost control.
May: Skye is living proof that you did.
Skye: You finish indexing Lincoln?
Simmons: Yes. But, um, I actually went to get… well, I… I thought you might like this. Snagged it off the bus before it went down. Thought it might be something you… well, anyway, here you go.
Skye: Thank you.
Fitz: Yeah, she, um… she shakes. But you’re not doing anything. That’s why it’s funny.
Coulson: Time to go.
Skye: How did it go?
Lincoln: The indexing? They just asked a lot of questions. But I’m sure you guys already have my blood from when I was out, right?
Coulson: It’s protocol.
Lincoln: HYDRA said the same thing.
Coulson: I know you’ve been through a lot, but you can trust us. You’ll see. So, how does this work? You just click your heels together and whisper, “there’s no place like home?”
Skye: Sort of, actually. Gordon explained it. He can sense us. It’s this thing called quantum entanglement, and, um… yeah, he’ll… he’ll find us. As long as we’re nowhere near any of you guys.
Coulson: Okay. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Skye: Okay.
Coulson: Okay.
Raina: Gordon! Gordon! Thank god! I had another vision. S.H.I.E.L.D., they’re coming.
Gordon: Here? What do you mean?
Raina: I saw Quinjets raining fire on us. Afterlife in flames.
Gordon: We have to warn Jiaying.
Raina: No. That’s why it starts. She can’t be the one who talks to them. Jiaying can’t meet with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Gordon: If it’s not Jiaying, then who?
Raina: Well, maybe it should be me.
Jiaying: How’s it coming along?
Woman: We’re packing up the crates now. Is everything okay? Should we be worried?
Jiaying: Of course not. This is merely a precaution.
Woman: Okay.
Jiaying: Are you all right?
Skye: Yeah.
Jiaying: What happened?
Lincoln: A lot. But I’m okay.
Skye: A doctor at S.H.I.E.L.D. patched him up.
Jiaying: S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Skye: We need to talk.
Jiaying: Go to the recovery room. Have one of ours take a look at you. Come. Tell me everything.
Jiaying: And you were just beginning to like it here.
Skye: We don’t have to leave. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t want that, either. Nothing has to change.
Jiaying: Sometimes, I forget how young you are.
Skye: Please just sit down with him. Coulson, he’s a good man. He’s… He’s the only person who’s ever tried to take care of me. And until now, he’s the closest I’ve had to family. Please, Mom.
Coulson: Agent Weaver, you’ll be with me on QJ36. We’ll land a good distance from their main buildings here. Now, I’ll go in first, alone, unarmed.
Gonzales: You shouldn’t be the one going in.
Coulson: Care to elaborate?
Gonzales: You’re too close to this. Skye’s like a daughter to you, and her mother is these people’s leader.
Coulson: I’m banking on that personal connection to get everyone through this safely.
Gonzales: You shouldn’t be. This is one of the greatest threats S.H.I.E.L.D.’s ever faced.
Weaver: I agree. A whole race of people with powers.
Gonzales: And you’ve proven time and again that you’re not objective when it comes to Skye.
Morse: That’s your opinion, not fact.
Gonzales: Want to talk facts? Ultron was created because people were too close to Tony Stark. They were blinded by his charm. They trusted him. Never even thought to look at what he was working on. And the Avengers, they let one man do whatever he wanted, and the world was almost destroyed for it. We’re S.H.I.E.L.D. We’re better than that. Or at least we should be.
Coulson: May? You’re awfully quiet.
May: Gonzales should go.
Coulson: Okay, then. I asked you to stay and give me advice. I’d be a fool not to take it. As director, I’ll quarterback the mission from here. Gonzales and Weaver, you’re on QJ36.
Fitz: Sure you don’t need any help with the indexing?
Simmons: Do you actually want to?
Fitz: You almost died last time.
Simmons: Last time was HYDRA and Ward. And even that worked out mostly okay.
Fitz: You know, you shouldn’t feel bad about Ward. I wanted to… kill him, too. And I couldn’t. Means we’re better than him.
Simmons: I did try to kill him, Fitz, and I’m kicking myself that I failed. The next terrible thing he does is on me.
Agent 33: Bobbi, Coulson wants us to scout ahead. Already locked in the coordinates.
Morse: Okay.
Coulson: Mack. Aren’t you supposed to be down with Gonzales and Weaver?
Mack: I never minced words with you before, sir, and I’m not going to now. I’m leaving. The fact that Theta Protocol turned out to be a Helicarrier doesn’t change things for me. Fury brought you back from the dead, and he used alien blood to do it. And you can’t be blamed for what happened to you, but you can’t be trusted, either.
Coulson: I’m in full control of my actions.
Mack: I had my own brush with something alien, and I know better than to mess with things I can’t understand. But it seems like you haven’t learned that lesson.
Coulson: I’ll have you reassigned to the carrier, under Gonzales.
Mack: No. As much as I like and respect you, sir, if you’re the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., I don’t want any part in it. I’ll go to the carrier, but it’ll be to collect my things.
Coulson: You’ve been with S.H.I.E.L.D., what, 13 years? I’m sorry to lose you. All right, let’s get those jets in the air.
Woman: Quinjet-36, final check, clear to go.
Man: Quinjet-36, clear to take off.
Cal: S.H.I.E.L.D.? No, no, no, no. They cannot come here. You mustn’t allow it!
Jiaying: I don’t have a choice.
Cal: Oh. I’m sorry. That looked very old. Was… Was it old?
Jiaying: Cal, you’ve met these people. Tell me honestly, can we trust them?
Cal: I only know a few of them, none of whom I’ve enjoyed. Phil Coulson is my least favorite, but he does care about our Daisy.
Jiaying: She was telling me about something called the index.
Cal: The index? Do they want to…? No, no, no. They will brand you, all of you. You have power here, lots of it.
Jiaying: To do what? Openly attack them? Blast their planes out of the sky?
Cal: Well, for a start.
Jiaying: Our daughter wouldn’t want that. And my people would never blindly follow me into a war.
Cal: I would.
Jiaying: So many people diminish with age, but you, you’re as bold as the day I met you.
Cal: I must look like an old man to you now.
Jiaying: No. This is the same face I fell in love with. It’s me who’s changed. We can’t lose our daughter to these people again. They’re terrified of us, of our powers. What can I do to convince them that we don’t mean any harm?
Cal: Give me to them. They think I’m a murderer, which is technically true. Let them have me. S.H.I.E.L.D. loves it when they get to lock someone up. High fives all around.
Jiaying: Cal, I can’t.
Cal: Let me protect my family the way I couldn’t before. Please.
Morse: Mack quit today. You ever wonder who you’d be without S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Agent 33: Actually, been giving that a lot of thought recently. You?
Morse: Hunter asked me to leave once, to be with him. It was the one time I was tempted to walk away.
Hunter: You’re really gonna let Captain Ahab just waltz in there and have a fireside chat with Skye’s mum?
Coulson: I am, though that is a really strange way of putting it.
Fitz: What if the Council is wrong? I mean, Gonzales has never…
Coulson: It’s not the Council versus us, Fitz. Not anymore. And they’re right. I haven’t always made the right call, especially when it comes to Skye. If I don’t put my faith in them, then S.H.I.E.L.D. will fall apart all over again.
Hunter: Hate to break it to you, but S.H.I.E.L.D. will also fall apart if a dozen angry enhanced blokes rain terror on us all.
Fitz: Yeah.
Coulson: I think we’ve been spending too much time together.
Jiaying: Gordon. What is it? What’s wrong?
Gonzales: Were you able to locate our insurance policy?
Weaver: Took some digging, and I’d appreciate a bit more notice in the future.
May: 10 minutes out.
Gonzales: Copy that, Agent May.
Morse: Hey, May, autopilot has us descending. You sure about those coordinates?
Agent 33: Funny how you’re so broken up about betraying Hunter. ‘Cause it seems like you couldn’t care less about what you did to me.
Morse: Kara.
Kara: You just sat there, pretending to comfort me. But you were just trying to see if I remembered. Well, I do.
Simmons: Sir, there are a lot more unknowns than we anticipated.
Gonzales: If Skye’s done her job and their leader agrees to meet, I’ll handle the rest.
May: Lock in. Touchdown in five.
Raina: I always knew my life was building up to something, that I had a purpose. It’s nice to finally see what it is. Where did you take Jiaying? I would hate for her to be someplace uncomfortable.
Jiaying: Some would call your transformation a curse. But at Afterlife, we choose to call it a gift. Why? Because we don’t want the way that others see us to define who we are. But you have used your powers to manipulate those around you, and you’ve taken advantage of my good faith.
Raina: No. You have to listen to me.
Skye: Don’t. It’s the same with you every time.
Raina: No, it’s not! I’m trying to save us!
Jiaying: There’s not a single soul that knows you who trusts you, Raina. Keep her here until S.H.I.E.L.D. is gone. Then we’ll decide your fate.
Raina: You have to believe me. Something terrible is going to happen unless you do what I say! You’ll regret this.
Skye: Where’s Coulson?
Gonzales: At headquarters. And I represent S.H.I.E.L.D. with his same intentions. I might ask why he’s here, though.
Jiaying: You returned Lincoln and Skye to us. We’d like to return someone of interest to you. He’s killed agents of yours, hasn’t he?
Cal: Uh, no. No, not S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. I don’t think. No, just people who had it coming.
Jiaying: We pride ourselves on doing the right thing. And as much as this pains me, I do understand the larger goal.
Gonzales: I’ll call one of my people to take him.
Jiaying: Skye can. Would you take your father to the agents outside? I’m sure mister…
Gonzales: Gonzales, Robert.
Jiaying: Robert and I have much to discuss.
Cal: You know, I was always excited to meet you. even when you were a little bit of nothing in your mother’s belly. Oh, I had all these ideas in my head as to what kind of woman you’d turn out to be, and you really are magnificent. I’m very grateful I got a chance to know you.
Skye: I’m glad I got to know you, too.
Gonzales: Skye told me what HYDRA did to you. It’s shameful.
Jiaying: If a long life has taught me anything, it’s that you can never truly be prepared for what people are capable of.
Gonzales: HYDRA took from me, too. We share the same scars, but it’s important that you know that we are not them. I have something for you. Go on. Open it.
Skye: What happened to Coulson? Did they do something to him?
May: We all felt that it was best to have someone more objective to meet with your mother.
Skye: Gonzales sent people to kill me a few weeks ago.
May: He’s a much better man than you think.
Skye: What about you? Why can’t you be in there right now?
May: I told you, we needed someone objective.
Gonzales: I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you. A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.
Jiaying: Where did you…?
Gonzales: S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it from Whitehall’s office after his death. I know that you were separated from your daughter. I thought that that might belong to her. A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn’t it?
Jiaying: I never got a chance to give it to her. I kept hoping that if she was alive, evil would never find her. Not like it did me.
May: I hope your mother is everything you wanted her to be.
Gonzales: S.H.I.E.L.D. has a very long and sometimes violent history with enhanced people, but the truth is, sometimes good people get powers, and sometimes bad. We’re there to protect the public when it’s the latter.
Jiaying: And how would you like me to help you do that?
Gonzales: I would like to meet your people, learn about their powers. We’ll keep a record, and if any ever try to do someone harm, we’ll be there to stop them. That’s why S.H.I.E.L.D. exists.
Jiaying: I have a gift in return, a piece of our history, something that might interest you. May even be worth indexing. That’s what you like to call it, right? I have lived enough life to see countless people profiled for their differences. It’s amazing how many generations fall into the same trap. What is it that makes people feel they have the right to do that? Fear. That’s what it is.
Gonzales: S.H.I.E.L.D. ’s goal is to protect everyone.
May: They turned over Cal.
Coulson: We’ll deal with him when you get back to H.Q.
Man: We found these vials on him, ma'am.
Weaver: What are these?
Cal: Beats me.
Jiaying: Fear drives us to do things we would otherwise never do. That’s why I first started experimenting with Terrigen crystals. We only had five Diviners in our possession. I knew if they were destroyed, we’d lose our ability to transform, an entire race gone forever. So we decided to make our own. As some have said, discovery requires experimentation. Eventually, we melted a Diviner down and grew new crystals from it. Unfortunately, we could never quite separate the Diviner metal out. It’s now laced within them. See? This wasn’t a problem for Inhumans, of course. The Diviner’s harmless to us. But for humans, well… Let’s hope you’re one of us.
Gonzales: No! Stop!
Jiaying: How dare you compare your scars to mine? You’re nothing like me, like us. Whitehall cut me to pieces. He ripped out my organs and stuffed them in jars! I will never let that happen to my daughter, to any of my people!
Gonzales: You’ll get everyone killed, you crazy…
Skye: Mom?
Man: What’s going on in there?
Skye: Mom! Mom!
Jiaying: He tried to kill me. S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to kill me. This is war.
Skye: Mom!
Man: Agent Morse, what’s your twenty? Agent Morse… Agent Morse, what is your status?
Ward: You did good, baby. Fooled every one of them.
Kara: It was hard being away from you.
Ward: It’s better when we’re together.
Kara: Why can’t we kill her now?
Ward: Closure’s about so much more than that. It’s about digging in, doing the work. I’ll show you what I mean. And then we’ll kill her.
Kara: She’s waking up.
Ward: We don’t want that.
